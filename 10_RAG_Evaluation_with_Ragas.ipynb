    "CloudFlow is a distributed cloud platform built on microservices architecture. The platform consists of three main layers that work together to provide a robust, scalable infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API Gateway layer handles all incoming requests using OAuth 2.0 authentication and routes them through our service mesh powered by Istio. This layer provides load balancing, SSL termination, and request routing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Service Mesh layer orchestrates communication between microservices, providing service discovery, health checking, and automatic failover. It uses Kubernetes for container orchestration across multiple availability zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Storage layer implements a distributed database system with automatic replication across three availability zones. This ensures data durability and supports horizontal scaling based on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "CloudFlow guarantees 99.99% uptime SLA with triple redundancy across availability zones. The platform supports horizontal scaling with automatic load balancing, allowing each service to scale independently based on CPU and memory metrics.\"\"\",\n",

    "CloudFlow implements sophisticated auto-scaling mechanisms to handle varying workloads efficiently. The platform monitors real-time metrics to make intelligent scaling decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) adjusts the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization (target: 70%) and memory usage (target: 80%). When these thresholds are exceeded for more than 3 consecutive minutes, the system automatically provisions additional pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertical scaling adjusts resource allocation for individual services. CloudFlow can increase or decrease CPU and memory limits without downtime, using Kubernetes resource management capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform supports bursting to handle sudden traffic spikes. During burst periods, CloudFlow can temporarily scale up to 500% of baseline capacity for up to 15 minutes before triggering permanent scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load balancing distributes traffic across all available pods using a weighted round-robin algorithm. Health checks run every 10 seconds, and unhealthy pods are automatically removed from the rotation within 30 seconds.\"\"\",\n",

    "This guide covers the most common errors encountered when using CloudFlow and their solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error: \"Invalid API Key\" (401)\n",
    "Solution: Verify your API key format starts with \"cf_live_\" and is exactly 40 characters. Check for extra spaces or newlines. Generate a new API key if the issue persists. API keys are case-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error: \"Rate Limit Exceeded\" (429)\n",
    "Solution: Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic. Check X-RateLimit-Reset header to know when limits reset. Consider upgrading to a higher tier if you consistently hit limits. Use batch endpoints to reduce request count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error: \"Resource Not Found\" (404)\n",
    "Solution: Verify the resource ID is correct and the resource hasn't been deleted. Use the /api/v1/resources endpoint to list available resources. Check if you're using the correct API version (/v1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Error: \"Timeout\" (504)\n",
    "Solution: Increase client timeout to at least 30 seconds. For long-running operations, use async endpoints and poll for results. Check CloudFlow status page for any service degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error: \"Validation Error\" (422)\n",
    "Solution: Review the error details field for specific validation failures. Common issues: missing required fields, invalid data types, values outside allowed ranges. Consult API documentation for correct request format.\"\"\",\n",

    "When troubleshooting issues with CloudFlow, follow this systematic debugging approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 - Check Service Status: Visit status.cloudflow.io to verify all systems are operational. Subscribe to status updates to receive notifications about incidents and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2 - Review API Logs: Access detailed API logs in the CloudFlow dashboard under Analytics > API Logs. Filter by time range, status code, and endpoint. Look for patterns in failed requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3 - Enable Debug Mode: Add X-CloudFlow-Debug: true header to requests to receive detailed debug information in responses. Debug mode provides request ID, processing time breakdown, and backend service information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4 - Test with curl: Isolate issues by testing with curl commands. Example: curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" -H \"X-CloudFlow-Debug: true\" https://api.cloudflow.io/v1/resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5 - Check Network Connectivity: Ensure your network allows outbound HTTPS traffic to *.cloudflow.io on port 443. Verify DNS resolution is working correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6 - Verify SDK Version: If using CloudFlow SDK, ensure you're running the latest version. Outdated SDKs may not support new API features or may have known bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 7 - Contact Support: If issues persist, contact CloudFlow support with the request ID from failed requests. Support responds within 24 hours for Standard tier, 4 hours for Premium, 1 hour for Enterprise.\"\"\",\n",

      "Question 1: What is CloudFlow's uptime SLA?\n",
      "Answer: CloudFlow's uptime SLA is 99.99% for the Enterprise tier and 99.95% for the Premium tier. The Standard tier offers a 99.9% uptime SLA.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Question 2: How do I authenticate with CloudFlow APIs?\n",
      "Answer: You can authenticate with CloudFlow APIs using either OAuth 2.0 or API Keys:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **OAuth 2.0**: Recommended for user-facing applications.  \n",
      "   - Use the Authorization Code flow to obtain access tokens (valid for 1 hour) and refresh tokens (valid for 30 days).  \n",
      "   - Direct users to the authorization endpoint at `https://auth.cloudflow.io/oauth/authorize` with your `client_id` and `redirect_uri` parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **API Keys**: Ideal for server-to-server communication and background jobs.  \n",
      "   - API keys have the format `cf_live_` followed by 32 alphanumeric characters.  \n",
      "   - API keys do not expire unless explicitly revoked.  \n",
      "   - Include the API key in the Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.  \n",
      "   - API keys can be scoped to specific permissions (read, write, admin) and restricted to specific IP addresses for enhanced security.\n",
      "\n",
      "All API requests must be made over HTTPS; HTTP requests will be rejected with a 403 error.\n",

[CloudFlow API Authentication\\n\\nCloudFlow APIs support two authentication methods: OAuth 2.0 and API Keys. Both methods provide secure access to platform resources.\\n\\nOAuth 2.0 is recommended for user-facing applications. It supports the Authorization Code flow and provides access tokens valid for 1 hour and refresh tokens valid for 30 days. To implement OAuth 2.0, direct users to the authorization endpoint at https://auth.cloudflow.io/oauth/authorize with your client_id and redirect_uri parameters.\\n\\nAPI Keys are ideal for server-to-server communication and background jobs. Each API key has the format \"cf_live_\" followed by 32 alphanumeric characters. API keys never expire unless explicitly revoked.\\n\\nTo authenticate requests, include your API key in the Authorization header: \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\". All API requests must be made over HTTPS; HTTP requests will be rejected with a 403 error., CloudFlow Security Features\\n\\nSecurity is a top priority at CloudFlow. We implement industry-leading security practices to protect your data and applications.\\n\\nEncryption: All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. Data in transit uses TLS 1.3 with perfect forward secrecy. Encryption keys are rotated every 90 days using AWS KMS.\\n\\nNetwork Security: CloudFlow runs in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with strict network segmentation. Public endpoints are protected by Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules that block common attack patterns. DDoS protection is provided by Cloudflare with mitigation capacity up to 50 Gbps.\\n\\nAccess Control: All resources support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with customizable roles and permissions. We support integration with external identity providers via SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect., CloudFlow Architecture Overview\\n\\nCloudFlow is a distributed cloud platform built on microservices architecture. The platform consists of three main layers that work together to provide a robust, scalable infrastructure.\\n\\nThe API Gateway layer handles all incoming requests using OAuth 2.0 authentication and routes them through our service mesh powered by Istio. This layer provides load balancing, SSL termination, and request routing capabilities.\\n\\nThe Service Mesh layer orchestrates communication between microservices, providing service discovery, health checking, and automatic failover. It uses Kubernetes for container orchestration across multiple availability zones.\\n\\nThe Data Storage layer implements a distributed database system with automatic replication across three availability zones. This ensures data durability and supports horizontal scaling based on demand., API keys can be scoped to specific permissions (read, write, admin) and restricted to specific IP addresses for enhanced security. You can manage your API keys through the CloudFlow dashboard or the /api/v1/keys endpoint.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     CloudFlow uses OAuth 2.0 and API Keys as authentication protocols.

[CloudFlow Architecture Overview\\n\\nCloudFlow is a distributed cloud platform built on microservices architecture. The platform consists of three main layers that work together to provide a robust, scalable infrastructure.\\n\\nThe API Gateway layer handles all incoming requests using OAuth 2.0 authentication and routes them through our service mesh powered by Istio. This layer provides load balancing, SSL termination, and request routing capabilities.\\n\\nThe Service Mesh layer orchestrates communication between microservices, providing service discovery, health checking, and automatic failover. It uses Kubernetes for container orchestration across multiple availability zones.\\n\\nThe Data Storage layer implements a distributed database system with automatic replication across three availability zones. This ensures data durability and supports horizontal scaling based on demand., CloudFlow System Components\\n\\nCloudFlow's architecture comprises several key components that work in harmony to deliver reliable cloud services.\\n\\nThe Control Plane manages the overall system state, including service registration, configuration management, and orchestration. It runs on a dedicated cluster with five replicas for high availability.\\n\\nThe Data Plane handles actual request processing and data flow. It consists of worker nodes that execute application workloads and process user requests. Each data plane node has 16 CPU cores and 64GB RAM.\\n\\nThe Observability Stack includes Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation. Metrics are collected every 15 seconds and retained for 90 days.\\n\\nThe Service Registry maintains a real-time directory of all available services and their endpoints. It uses etcd for distributed consensus and supports automatic service discovery with DNS-based lookups., CloudFlow guarantees 99.99% uptime SLA with triple redundancy across availability zones. The platform supports horizontal scaling with automatic load balancing, allowing each service to scale independently based on CPU and memory metrics., CloudFlow Security Features\\n\\nSecurity is a top priority at CloudFlow. We implement industry-leading security practices to protect your data and applications.\\n\\nEncryption: All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. Data in transit uses TLS 1.3 with perfect forward secrecy. Encryption keys are rotated every 90 days using AWS KMS.\\n\\nNetwork Security: CloudFlow runs in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with strict network segmentation.

[CloudFlow Scaling Mechanisms\\n\\nCloudFlow implements sophisticated auto-scaling mechanisms to handle varying workloads efficiently. The platform monitors real-time metrics to make intelligent scaling decisions.\\n\\nHorizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) adjusts the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization (target: 70%) and memory usage (target: 80%). When these thresholds are exceeded for more than 3 consecutive minutes, the system automatically provisions additional pods.\\n\\nVertical scaling adjusts resource allocation for individual services. CloudFlow can increase or decrease CPU and memory limits without downtime, using Kubernetes resource management capabilities.\\n\\nThe platform supports bursting to handle sudden traffic spikes. During burst periods, CloudFlow can temporarily scale up to 500% of baseline capacity for up to 15 minutes before triggering permanent scaling., CloudFlow Monitoring and Observability\\n\\nEffective monitoring ensures your CloudFlow applications remain healthy and performant.\\n\\nMetrics Collection: CloudFlow automatically collects key metrics including request rate, error rate, latency (p50, p95, p99), and resource utilization. Access metrics via the dashboard or Metrics API at /api/v1/metrics.\\n\\nCustom Metrics: Send custom application metrics using the StatsD protocol. CloudFlow aggregates custom metrics every 60 seconds and retains them for 90 days.\\n\\nAlerting: Configure alerts for critical conditions like error rate >5%, latency >500ms, or approaching rate limits. CloudFlow supports alerting via email, SMS, Slack, PagerDuty, and webhooks.\\n\\nDistributed Tracing: Enable distributed tracing to track requests across services. CloudFlow supports OpenTelemetry and provides trace visualization in the dashboard. Sample rate: 10% of requests (configurable up to 100%)., CloudFlow guarantees 99.99% uptime SLA with triple redundancy across availability zones. The platform supports horizontal scaling with automatic load balancing, allowing each service to scale independently based on CPU and memory metrics., CloudFlow System Components\\n\\nCloudFlow's architecture comprises several key components that work in harmony to deliver reliable cloud services.\\n\\nThe Control Plane manages the overall system state, including service registration, configuration management, and orchestration. It runs on a dedicated cluster with five replicas for high availability.\\n\\nThe Data Plane handles actual request processing and data flow. It consists of worker nodes that execute application workloads and process user requests.

Use CloudFlow's built-in Redis cache for frequently accessed data with TTL between 5-60 minutes. Cache API responses on the client side and respect Cache-Control headers.\\n\\nRequest Optimization: Batch multiple operations into single API calls when possible. Use pagination for large result sets (recommended page size: 50-100 items). Implement request compression using gzip to reduce bandwidth.\\n\\nConnection Management: Reuse HTTP connections with keep-alive headers. Maintain a connection pool with 5-10 concurrent connections per API key. Set appropriate timeouts: connection timeout 10s, read timeout 30s.\\n\\nQuery Efficiency: Use field filtering to request only required data: /resources?fields=id,name,status. Leverage server-side filtering instead of retrieving all data and filtering locally., Step 5 - Check Network Connectivity: Ensure your network allows outbound HTTPS traffic to *.cloudflow.io on port 443. Verify DNS resolution is working correctly.\\n\\nStep 6 - Verify SDK Version: If using CloudFlow SDK, ensure you're running the latest version. Outdated SDKs may not support new API features or may have known bugs.\\n\\nStep 7 - Contact Support: If issues persist, contact CloudFlow support with the request ID from failed requests. Support responds within 24 hours for Standard tier, 4 hours for Premium, 1 hour for Enterprise., CloudFlow Debugging Guide\\n\\nWhen troubleshooting issues with CloudFlow, follow this systematic debugging approach.\\n\\nStep 1 - Check Service Status: Visit status.cloudflow.io to verify all systems are operational. Subscribe to status updates to receive notifications about incidents and maintenance.\\n\\nStep 2 - Review API Logs: Access detailed API logs in the CloudFlow dashboard under Analytics > API Logs. Filter by time range, status code, and endpoint. Look for patterns in failed requests.\\n\\nStep 3 - Enable Debug Mode: Add X-CloudFlow-Debug: true header to requests to receive detailed debug information in responses. Debug mode provides request ID, processing time breakdown, and backend service information.\\n\\nStep 4 - Test with curl: Isolate issues by testing with curl commands. Example: curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" -H \"X-CloudFlow-Debug: true\" https://api.cloudflow.io/v1/resources, Asynchronous Processing: For long-running operations, use CloudFlow's async API endpoints. Poll for results using the returned job_id rather than blocking on the initial request.\\n\\nCDN Usage: Serve static assets through CloudFlow's global CDN with 150+ edge locations. Configure appropriate cache headers for optimal performance: max-age=3600 for semi-static content.]                            To optimize CloudFlow API performance, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Caching Strategy**: \\n   - Use CloudFlow's built-in Redis cache for frequently accessed data with a TTL of 5-60 minutes.\\n   - Cache API responses on the client side and respect Cache-Control headers.\\n\\n2. **Request Optimization**: \\n   - Batch multiple operations into single API calls when possible.\\n   - Use pagination for large result sets with a recommended page size of 50-100 items.\\n   - Implement request compression using gzip to reduce bandwidth usage.\\n\\n3. **Connection Management**: \\n   - Reuse HTTP connections with keep-alive headers.\\n   - Maintain a connection pool with 5-10 concurrent connections per API key.\\n   - Set appropriate timeouts: connection timeout of 10 seconds and read timeout of 30 seconds.\\n\\n4. **Query Efficiency**: \\n   - Use field filtering to request only the required data (e.g., `/resources?fields=id,name,status`).\\n   - Leverage server-side filtering instead of retrieving all data and filtering locally.\\n\\n5. **Network Connectivity**: \\n   - Ensure your network allows outbound HTTPS traffic to `*.cloudflow.io` on port 443.\\n   - Verify DNS resolution is working correctly.\\n\\n6. **SDK Version**: \\n   - Ensure you are using the latest version of the CloudFlow SDK to avoid compatibility issues and bugs.\\n\\n7. **Contact Support**: \\n   - If issues persist, contact CloudFlow support with the request ID from failed requests.

[CloudFlow API Authentication\\n\\nCloudFlow APIs support two authentication methods: OAuth 2.0 and API Keys. Both methods provide secure access to platform resources.\\n\\nOAuth 2.0 is recommended for user-facing applications. It supports the Authorization Code flow and provides access tokens valid for 1 hour and refresh tokens valid for 30 days. To implement OAuth 2.0, direct users to the authorization endpoint at https://auth.cloudflow.io/oauth/authorize with your client_id and redirect_uri parameters.\\n\\nAPI Keys are ideal for server-to-server communication and background jobs. Each API key has the format \"cf_live_\" followed by 32 alphanumeric characters. API keys never expire unless explicitly revoked.\\n\\nTo authenticate requests, include your API key in the Authorization header: \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\". All API requests must be made over HTTPS; HTTP requests will be rejected with a 403 error., API keys can be scoped to specific permissions (read, write, admin) and restricted to specific IP addresses for enhanced security. You can manage your API keys through the CloudFlow dashboard or the /api/v1/keys endpoint., OAuth 2.0 authenticated requests have separate, higher limits: 5,000 requests per hour for Standard tier., CloudFlow Security Features\\n\\nSecurity is a top priority at CloudFlow. We implement industry-leading security practices to protect your data and applications.\\n\\nEncryption: All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. Data in transit uses TLS 1.3 with perfect forward secrecy. Encryption keys are rotated every 90 days using AWS KMS.\\n\\nNetwork Security: CloudFlow runs in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with strict network segmentation. Public endpoints are protected by Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules that block common attack patterns. DDoS protection is provided by Cloudflare with mitigation capacity up to 50 Gbps.\\n\\nAccess Control: All resources support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with customizable roles and permissions. We support integration with external identity providers via SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect.]                                                                                                                                           OAuth 2.0 authentication differs from API key authentication in CloudFlow in the following ways:\\n\\n1. **Use Case**:  \\n   - OAuth 2.0 is recommended for user-facing applications, as it involves user authorization and provides access tokens and refresh tokens.  \\n   - API keys are ideal for server-to-server communication and background jobs, as they do not require user interaction.\\n\\n2. **Token Expiry**:  \\n   - OAuth 2.0 access tokens are valid for 1 hour, and refresh tokens are valid for 30 days.  \\n   - API keys do not expire unless explicitly revoked.\\n\\n3. **Authentication Method**:  \\n   - OAuth 2.0 requires directing users to an authorization endpoint (`https://auth.cloudflow.io/oauth/authorize`) with `client_id` and `redirect_uri` parameters to obtain tokens.  \\n   - API keys are included directly in the Authorization header (`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`) for requests.\\n\\n4. **Security Features**:  \\n   - API keys can be scoped to specific permissions (read, write, admin) and restricted to specific IP addresses for enhanced security.  \\n   - OAuth 2.0 provides higher rate limits for authenticated requests (5,000 requests per hour for Standard tier).\\n\\n5. **Expiration and Management**:  \\n   - OAuth 2.0 tokens require periodic renewal using refresh tokens.  \\n   - API keys are managed through the CloudFlow dashboard or the `/api/v1/keys` endpoint and do not require renewal unless revoked.  OAuth 2.0 is recommended for user-facing applications with access tokens valid for 1 hour and provides the Authorization Code flow, while API keys are ideal for server-to-server communication, never expire unless revoked, and have a simpler implementation.      1.000000          1.000000           1.000000        1.000000               0.500000                               NaN\n",
