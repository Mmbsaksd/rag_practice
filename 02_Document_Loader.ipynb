Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\attention.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\attention.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 4, 'page_label': '5'}, page_content='output values.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel.

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\attention.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7'}, page_content='length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\attention.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}, page_content='Table 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FR\\nByteNet [18] 23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39] 39.2 1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38] 24.6 39.92 2.3 · 1019 1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9] 25.16 40.46 9.6 · 1018 1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32] 26.03 40.56 2.0 · 1019 1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] 40.4 8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38] 26.30 41.16 1.8 · 1020 1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9] 26.36 41.29 7.7 · 1019 1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big) 28.4 41.8 2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\attention.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\attention.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention O(n2 · d) O(1) O(1)\\nRecurrent O(n · d2) O(n) O(n)\\nConvolutional O(k · n · d2) O(1) O(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r · n · d) O(1) O(n/r)\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12].

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\attention.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}, page_content='Table 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FR\\nByteNet [18] 23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39] 39.2 1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38] 24.6 39.92 2.3 · 1019 1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9] 25.16 40.46 9.6 · 1018 1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32] 26.03 40.56 2.0 · 1019 1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] 40.4 8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38] 26.30 41.16 1.8 · 1020 1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9] 26.36 41.29 7.7 · 1019 1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big) 28.4 41.8 2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized.

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature.

Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences.

In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video.

Input the original question and the retrieved chunks together into LLM to generate the final answer.\\nwidespread adoption of ChatGPT. The Naive RAG follows\\na traditional process that includes indexing, retrieval, and\\ngeneration, which is also characterized as a “Retrieve-Read”\\nframework [7].\\nIndexing starts with the cleaning and extraction of raw data\\nin diverse formats like PDF, HTML, Word, and Markdown,\\nwhich is then converted into a uniform plain text format. To\\naccommodate the context limitations of language models, text\\nis segmented into smaller, digestible chunks. Chunks are then\\nencoded into vector representations using an embedding model\\nand stored in vector database. This step is crucial for enabling\\nefficient similarity searches in the subsequent retrieval phase.\\nRetrieval. Upon receipt of a user query, the RAG system\\nemploys the same encoding model utilized during the indexing\\nphase to transform the query into a vector representation.\\nIt then computes the similarity scores between the query\\nvector and the vector of chunks within the indexed corpus.\\nThe system prioritizes and retrieves the top K chunks that\\ndemonstrate the greatest similarity to the query. These chunks\\nare subsequently used as the expanded context in prompt.\\nGeneration. The posed query and selected documents are\\nsynthesized into a coherent prompt to which a large language\\nmodel is tasked with formulating a response. The model’s\\napproach to answering may vary depending on task-specific\\ncriteria, allowing it to either draw upon its inherent parametric\\nknowledge or restrict its responses to the information con-\\ntained within the provided documents. In cases of ongoing\\ndialogues, any existing conversational history can be integrated\\ninto the prompt, enabling the model to engage in multi-turn\\ndialogue interactions effectively.\\nHowever, Naive RAG encounters notable drawbacks:\\nRetrieval Challenges . The retrieval phase often struggles\\nwith precision and recall, leading to the selection of misaligned\\nor irrelevant chunks, and the missing of crucial information.\\nGeneration Difficulties. In generating responses, the model\\nmay face the issue of hallucination, where it produces con-\\ntent not supported by the retrieved context. This phase can\\nalso suffer from irrelevance, toxicity, or bias in the outputs,\\ndetracting from the quality and reliability of the responses.\\nAugmentation Hurdles . Integrating retrieved information\\nwith the different task can be challenging, sometimes resulting\\nin disjointed or incoherent outputs. The process may also\\nencounter redundancy when similar information is retrieved\\nfrom multiple sources, leading to repetitive responses. Deter-\\nmining the significance and relevance of various passages and\\nensuring stylistic and tonal consistency add further complexity.\\nFacing complex issues, a single retrieval based on the original\\nquery may not suffice to acquire adequate context information.\\nMoreover, there’s a concern that generation models might\\noverly rely on augmented information, leading to outputs that\\nsimply echo retrieved content without adding insightful or\\nsynthesized information.\\nB. Advanced RAG\\nAdvanced RAG introduces specific improvements to over-\\ncome the limitations of Naive RAG. Focusing on enhancing re-\\ntrieval quality, it employs pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strate-\\ngies. To tackle the indexing issues, Advanced RAG refines\\nits indexing techniques through the use of a sliding window\\napproach, fine-grained segmentation, and the incorporation of\\nmetadata.

Comparison between the three paradigms of RAG. (Left) Naive RAG mainly consists of three parts: indexing, retrieval and generation. (Middle)\\nAdvanced RAG proposes multiple optimization strategies around pre-retrieval and post-retrieval, with a process similar to the Naive RAG, still following a\\nchain-like structure. (Right) Modular RAG inherits and develops from the previous paradigm, showcasing greater flexibility overall. This is evident in the\\nintroduction of multiple specific functional modules and the replacement of existing modules. The overall process is not limited to sequential retrieval and\\ngeneration; it includes methods such as iterative and adaptive retrieval.\\nPre-retrieval process. In this stage, the primary focus is\\non optimizing the indexing structure and the original query.\\nThe goal of optimizing indexing is to enhance the quality of\\nthe content being indexed. This involves strategies: enhancing\\ndata granularity, optimizing index structures, adding metadata,\\nalignment optimization, and mixed retrieval. While the goal\\nof query optimization is to make the user’s original question\\nclearer and more suitable for the retrieval task. Common\\nmethods include query rewriting query transformation, query\\nexpansion and other techniques [7], [9]–[11].\\nPost-Retrieval Process. Once relevant context is retrieved,\\nit’s crucial to integrate it effectively with the query. The main\\nmethods in post-retrieval process include rerank chunks and\\ncontext compressing. Re-ranking the retrieved information to\\nrelocate the most relevant content to the edges of the prompt is\\na key strategy. This concept has been implemented in frame-\\nworks such as LlamaIndex 2, LangChain3, and HayStack [12].\\nFeeding all relevant documents directly into LLMs can lead\\nto information overload, diluting the focus on key details with\\nirrelevant content.To mitigate this, post-retrieval efforts con-\\ncentrate on selecting the essential information, emphasizing\\ncritical sections, and shortening the context to be processed.\\n2https://www.llamaindex.ai\\n3https://www.langchain.com/\\nC. Modular RAG\\nThe modular RAG architecture advances beyond the for-\\nmer two RAG paradigms, offering enhanced adaptability and\\nversatility. It incorporates diverse strategies for improving its\\ncomponents, such as adding a search module for similarity\\nsearches and refining the retriever through fine-tuning. Inno-\\nvations like restructured RAG modules [13] and rearranged\\nRAG pipelines [14] have been introduced to tackle specific\\nchallenges. The shift towards a modular RAG approach is\\nbecoming prevalent, supporting both sequential processing and\\nintegrated end-to-end training across its components. Despite\\nits distinctiveness, Modular RAG builds upon the foundational\\nprinciples of Advanced and Naive RAG, illustrating a progres-\\nsion and refinement within the RAG family.\\n1) New Modules: The Modular RAG framework introduces\\nadditional specialized components to enhance retrieval and\\nprocessing capabilities. The Search module adapts to spe-\\ncific scenarios, enabling direct searches across various data\\nsources like search engines, databases, and knowledge graphs,\\nusing LLM-generated code and query languages [15]. RAG-\\nFusion addresses traditional search limitations by employing\\na multi-query strategy that expands user queries into diverse\\nperspectives, utilizing parallel vector searches and intelligent\\nre-ranking to uncover both explicit and transformative knowl-\\nedge [16].

Routing in the RAG system\\nnavigates through diverse data sources, selecting the optimal\\npathway for a query, whether it involves summarization,\\nspecific database searches, or merging different information\\nstreams [19]. The Predict module aims to reduce redundancy\\nand noise by generating context directly through the LLM,\\nensuring relevance and accuracy [13]. Lastly, the Task Adapter\\nmodule tailors RAG to various downstream tasks, automating\\nprompt retrieval for zero-shot inputs and creating task-specific\\nretrievers through few-shot query generation [20], [21] .This\\ncomprehensive approach not only streamlines the retrieval pro-\\ncess but also significantly improves the quality and relevance\\nof the information retrieved, catering to a wide array of tasks\\nand queries with enhanced precision and flexibility.\\n2) New Patterns: Modular RAG offers remarkable adapt-\\nability by allowing module substitution or reconfiguration\\nto address specific challenges. This goes beyond the fixed\\nstructures of Naive and Advanced RAG, characterized by a\\nsimple “Retrieve” and “Read” mechanism. Moreover, Modular\\nRAG expands this flexibility by integrating new modules or\\nadjusting interaction flow among existing ones, enhancing its\\napplicability across different tasks.\\nInnovations such as the Rewrite-Retrieve-Read [7]model\\nleverage the LLM’s capabilities to refine retrieval queries\\nthrough a rewriting module and a LM-feedback mechanism\\nto update rewriting model., improving task performance.\\nSimilarly, approaches like Generate-Read [13] replace tradi-\\ntional retrieval with LLM-generated content, while Recite-\\nRead [22] emphasizes retrieval from model weights, enhanc-\\ning the model’s ability to handle knowledge-intensive tasks.\\nHybrid retrieval strategies integrate keyword, semantic, and\\nvector searches to cater to diverse queries. Additionally, em-\\nploying sub-queries and hypothetical document embeddings\\n(HyDE) [11] seeks to improve retrieval relevance by focusing\\non embedding similarities between generated answers and real\\ndocuments.\\nAdjustments in module arrangement and interaction, such\\nas the Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) [23] framework\\nand the iterative Retrieve-Read-Retrieve-Read flow of ITER-\\nRETGEN [14], showcase the dynamic use of module out-\\nputs to bolster another module’s functionality, illustrating a\\nsophisticated understanding of enhancing module synergy.\\nThe flexible orchestration of Modular RAG Flow showcases\\nthe benefits of adaptive retrieval through techniques such as\\nFLARE [24] and Self-RAG [25]. This approach transcends\\nthe fixed RAG retrieval process by evaluating the necessity\\nof retrieval based on different scenarios. Another benefit of\\na flexible architecture is that the RAG system can more\\neasily integrate with other technologies (such as fine-tuning\\nor reinforcement learning) [26]. For example, this can involve\\nfine-tuning the retriever for better retrieval results, fine-tuning\\nthe generator for more personalized outputs, or engaging in\\ncollaborative fine-tuning [27].\\nD. RAG vs Fine-tuning\\nThe augmentation of LLMs has attracted considerable atten-\\ntion due to their growing prevalence. Among the optimization\\nmethods for LLMs, RAG is often compared with Fine-tuning\\n(FT) and prompt engineering. Each method has distinct charac-\\nteristics as illustrated in Figure 4. We used a quadrant chart to\\nillustrate the differences among three methods in two dimen-\\nsions: external knowledge requirements and model adaption\\nrequirements. Prompt engineering leverages a model’s inherent\\ncapabilities with minimum necessity for external knowledge\\nand model adaption. RAG can be likened to providing a model\\nwith a tailored textbook for information retrieval, ideal for pre-\\ncise information retrieval tasks. In contrast, FT is comparable\\nto a student internalizing knowledge over time, suitable for\\nscenarios requiring replication of specific structures, styles, or\\nformats.\\nRAG excels in dynamic environments by offering real-\\ntime knowledge updates and effective utilization of external\\nknowledge sources with high interpretability. However, it\\ncomes with higher latency and ethical considerations regarding\\ndata retrieval. On the other hand, FT is more static, requiring\\nretraining for updates but enabling deep customization of the\\nmodel’s behavior and style. It demands significant compu-\\ntational resources for dataset preparation and training, and\\nwhile it can reduce hallucinations, it may face challenges with\\nunfamiliar data.\\nIn multiple evaluations of their performance on various\\nknowledge-intensive tasks across different topics, [28] re-\\nvealed that while unsupervised fine-tuning shows some im-\\nprovement, RAG consistently outperforms it, for both exist-\\ning knowledge encountered during training and entirely new\\nknowledge. Additionally, it was found that LLMs struggle\\nto learn new factual information through unsupervised fine-\\ntuning. The choice between RAG and FT depends on the\\nspecific needs for data dynamics, customization, and com-\\nputational capabilities in the application context. RAG and\\nFT are not mutually exclusive and can complement each\\nother, enhancing a model’s capabilities at different levels.\\nIn some instances, their combined use may lead to optimal\\nperformance. The optimization process involving RAG and FT\\nmay require multiple iterations to achieve satisfactory results.\\nIII. R ETRIEVAL\\nIn the context of RAG, it is crucial to efficiently retrieve\\nrelevant documents from the data source. There are several\\nkey issues involved, such as the retrieval source, retrieval\\ngranularity, pre-processing of the retrieval, and selection of\\nthe corresponding embedding model.\\nA. Retrieval Source\\nRAG relies on external knowledge to enhance LLMs, while\\nthe type of retrieval source and the granularity of retrieval\\nunits both affect the final generation results.\\n1) Data Structure: Initially, text is s the mainstream source\\nof retrieval. Subsequently, the retrieval source expanded to in-\\nclude semi-structured data (PDF) and structured data (Knowl-\\nedge Graph, KG) for enhancement.

RAG compared with other model optimization methods in the aspects of “External Knowledge Required” and “Model Adaption Required”. Prompt\\nEngineering requires low modifications to the model and external knowledge, focusing on harnessing the capabilities of LLMs themselves. Fine-tuning, on\\nthe other hand, involves further training the model. In the early stages of RAG (Naive RAG), there is a low demand for model modifications. As research\\nprogresses, Modular RAG has become more integrated with fine-tuning techniques.\\nUnstructured Data , such as text, is the most widely used\\nretrieval source, which are mainly gathered from corpus. For\\nopen-domain question-answering (ODQA) tasks, the primary\\nretrieval sources are Wikipedia Dump with the current major\\nversions including HotpotQA 4 (1st October , 2017), DPR5 (20\\nDecember, 2018). In addition to encyclopedic data, common\\nunstructured data includes cross-lingual text [19] and domain-\\nspecific data (such as medical [67]and legal domains [29]).\\nSemi-structured data. typically refers to data that contains a\\ncombination of text and table information, such as PDF. Han-\\ndling semi-structured data poses challenges for conventional\\nRAG systems due to two main reasons. Firstly, text splitting\\nprocesses may inadvertently separate tables, leading to data\\ncorruption during retrieval. Secondly, incorporating tables into\\nthe data can complicate semantic similarity searches. When\\ndealing with semi-structured data, one approach involves lever-\\naging the code capabilities of LLMs to execute Text-2-SQL\\nqueries on tables within databases, such as TableGPT [85].\\nAlternatively, tables can be transformed into text format for\\nfurther analysis using text-based methods [75]. However, both\\nof these methods are not optimal solutions, indicating substan-\\ntial research opportunities in this area.\\nStructured data , such as knowledge graphs (KGs) [86] ,\\nwhich are typically verified and can provide more precise in-\\nformation. KnowledGPT [15] generates KB search queries and\\nstores knowledge in a personalized base, enhancing the RAG\\nmodel’s knowledge richness. In response to the limitations of\\nLLMs in understanding and answering questions about textual\\ngraphs, G-Retriever [84] integrates Graph Neural Networks\\n4https://hotpotqa.github.io/wiki-readme.html\\n5https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR\\n(GNNs), LLMs and RAG, enhancing graph comprehension\\nand question-answering capabilities through soft prompting\\nof the LLM, and employs the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree\\n(PCST) optimization problem for targeted graph retrieval. On\\nthe contrary, it requires additional effort to build, validate,\\nand maintain structured databases. On the contrary, it requires\\nadditional effort to build, validate, and maintain structured\\ndatabases.\\nLLMs-Generated Content. Addressing the limitations of\\nexternal auxiliary information in RAG, some research has\\nfocused on exploiting LLMs’ internal knowledge. SKR [58]\\nclassifies questions as known or unknown, applying retrieval\\nenhancement selectively. GenRead [13] replaces the retriever\\nwith an LLM generator, finding that LLM-generated contexts\\noften contain more accurate answers due to better alignment\\nwith the pre-training objectives of causal language modeling.\\nSelfmem [17] iteratively creates an unbounded memory pool\\nwith a retrieval-enhanced generator, using a memory selec-\\ntor to choose outputs that serve as dual problems to the\\noriginal question, thus self-enhancing the generative model.\\nThese methodologies underscore the breadth of innovative\\ndata source utilization in RAG, striving to improve model\\nperformance and task effectiveness.\\n2) Retrieval Granularity: Another important factor besides\\nthe data format of the retrieval source is the granularity of\\nthe retrieved data. Coarse-grained retrieval units theoretically\\ncan provide more relevant information for the problem, but\\nthey may also contain redundant content, which could distract\\nthe retriever and language models in downstream tasks [50],\\n[87]. On the other hand, fine-grained retrieval unit granularity\\nincreases the burden of retrieval and does not guarantee seman-\\ntic integrity and meeting the required knowledge.

Among them, DenseX [30]proposed the concept of\\nusing propositions as retrieval units. Propositions are defined\\nas atomic expressions in the text, each encapsulating a unique\\nfactual segment and presented in a concise, self-contained nat-\\nural language format. This approach aims to enhance retrieval\\nprecision and relevance. On the Knowledge Graph (KG),\\nretrieval granularity includes Entity, Triplet, and sub-Graph.\\nThe granularity of retrieval can also be adapted to downstream\\ntasks, such as retrieving Item IDs [40]in recommendation tasks\\nand Sentence pairs [38]. Detailed information is illustrated in\\nTable I.\\nB. Indexing Optimization\\nIn the Indexing phase, documents will be processed, seg-\\nmented, and transformed into Embeddings to be stored in a\\nvector database. The quality of index construction determines\\nwhether the correct context can be obtained in the retrieval\\nphase.\\n1) Chunking Strategy: The most common method is to split\\nthe document into chunks on a fixed number of tokens (e.g.,\\n100, 256, 512) [88]. Larger chunks can capture more context,\\nbut they also generate more noise, requiring longer processing\\ntime and higher costs. While smaller chunks may not fully\\nconvey the necessary context, they do have less noise. How-\\never, chunks leads to truncation within sentences, prompting\\nthe optimization of a recursive splits and sliding window meth-\\nods, enabling layered retrieval by merging globally related\\ninformation across multiple retrieval processes [89]. Never-\\ntheless, these approaches still cannot strike a balance between\\nsemantic completeness and context length. Therefore, methods\\nlike Small2Big have been proposed, where sentences (small)\\nare used as the retrieval unit, and the preceding and following\\nsentences are provided as (big) context to LLMs [90].\\n2) Metadata Attachments: Chunks can be enriched with\\nmetadata information such as page number, file name, au-\\nthor,category timestamp. Subsequently, retrieval can be filtered\\nbased on this metadata, limiting the scope of the retrieval.\\nAssigning different weights to document timestamps during\\nretrieval can achieve time-aware RAG, ensuring the freshness\\nof knowledge and avoiding outdated information.\\nIn addition to extracting metadata from the original doc-\\numents, metadata can also be artificially constructed. For\\nexample, adding summaries of paragraph, as well as intro-\\nducing hypothetical questions. This method is also known as\\nReverse HyDE. Specifically, using LLM to generate questions\\nthat can be answered by the document, then calculating the\\nsimilarity between the original question and the hypothetical\\nquestion during retrieval to reduce the semantic gap between\\nthe question and the answer.\\n3) Structural Index: One effective method for enhancing\\ninformation retrieval is to establish a hierarchical structure for\\nthe documents. By constructing In structure, RAG system can\\nexpedite the retrieval and processing of pertinent data.\\nHierarchical index structure . File are arranged in parent-\\nchild relationships, with chunks linked to them. Data sum-\\nmaries are stored at each node, aiding in the swift traversal\\nof data and assisting the RAG system in determining which\\nchunks to extract. This approach can also mitigate the illusion\\ncaused by block extraction issues.\\nKnowledge Graph index . Utilize KG in constructing the\\nhierarchical structure of documents contributes to maintaining\\nconsistency. It delineates the connections between different\\nconcepts and entities, markedly reducing the potential for\\nillusions. Another advantage is the transformation of the\\ninformation retrieval process into instructions that LLM can\\ncomprehend, thereby enhancing the accuracy of knowledge\\nretrieval and enabling LLM to generate contextually coherent\\nresponses, thus improving the overall efficiency of the RAG\\nsystem. To capture the logical relationship between document\\ncontent and structure, KGP [91] proposed a method of building\\nan index between multiple documents using KG. This KG\\nconsists of nodes (representing paragraphs or structures in the\\ndocuments, such as pages and tables) and edges (indicating\\nsemantic/lexical similarity between paragraphs or relationships\\nwithin the document structure), effectively addressing knowl-\\nedge retrieval and reasoning problems in a multi-document\\nenvironment.\\nC. Query Optimization\\nOne of the primary challenges with Naive RAG is its\\ndirect reliance on the user’s original query as the basis for\\nretrieval. Formulating a precise and clear question is difficult,\\nand imprudent queries result in subpar retrieval effectiveness.\\nSometimes, the question itself is complex, and the language\\nis not well-organized. Another difficulty lies in language\\ncomplexity ambiguity. Language models often struggle when\\ndealing with specialized vocabulary or ambiguous abbrevi-\\nations with multiple meanings. For instance, they may not\\ndiscern whether “LLM” refers to large language model or a\\nMaster of Laws in a legal context.\\n1) Query Expansion: Expanding a single query into mul-\\ntiple queries enriches the content of the query, providing\\nfurther context to address any lack of specific nuances, thereby\\nensuring the optimal relevance of the generated answers.\\nMulti-Query. By employing prompt engineering to expand\\nqueries via LLMs, these queries can then be executed in\\nparallel. The expansion of queries is not random, but rather\\nmeticulously designed.\\nSub-Query. The process of sub-question planning represents\\nthe generation of the necessary sub-questions to contextualize\\nand fully answer the original question when combined. This\\nprocess of adding relevant context is, in principle, similar\\nto query expansion. Specifically, a complex question can be\\ndecomposed into a series of simpler sub-questions using the\\nleast-to-most prompting method [92].\\nChain-of-Verification(CoVe). The expanded queries undergo\\nvalidation by LLM to achieve the effect of reducing halluci-\\nnations. Validated expanded queries typically exhibit higher\\nreliability [93].'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 8, 'page_label': '9'}, page_content='9\\n2) Query Transformation: The core concept is to retrieve\\nchunks based on a transformed query instead of the user’s\\noriginal query.\\nQuery Rewrite.The original queries are not always optimal\\nfor LLM retrieval, especially in real-world scenarios. There-\\nfore, we can prompt LLM to rewrite the queries. In addition to\\nusing LLM for query rewriting, specialized smaller language\\nmodels, such as RRR (Rewrite-retrieve-read) [7]. The imple-\\nmentation of the query rewrite method in the Taobao, known\\nas BEQUE [9] has notably enhanced recall effectiveness for\\nlong-tail queries, resulting in a rise in GMV .\\nAnother query transformation method is to use prompt\\nengineering to let LLM generate a query based on the original\\nquery for subsequent retrieval. HyDE [11] construct hypothet-\\nical documents (assumed answers to the original query). It\\nfocuses on embedding similarity from answer to answer rather\\nthan seeking embedding similarity for the problem or query.\\nUsing the Step-back Prompting method [10], the original\\nquery is abstracted to generate a high-level concept question\\n(step-back question). In the RAG system, both the step-back\\nquestion and the original query are used for retrieval, and both\\nthe results are utilized as the basis for language model answer\\ngeneration.\\n3) Query Routing: Based on varying queries, routing to\\ndistinct RAG pipeline,which is suitable for a versatile RAG\\nsystem designed to accommodate diverse scenarios.\\nMetadata Router/ Filter . The first step involves extracting\\nkeywords (entity) from the query, followed by filtering based\\non the keywords and metadata within the chunks to narrow\\ndown the search scope.\\nSemantic Router is another method of routing involves\\nleveraging the semantic information of the query. Specific\\napprach see Semantic Router 6. Certainly, a hybrid routing\\napproach can also be employed, combining both semantic and\\nmetadata-based methods for enhanced query routing.\\nD. Embedding\\nIn RAG, retrieval is achieved by calculating the similarity\\n(e.g. cosine similarity) between the embeddings of the ques-\\ntion and document chunks, where the semantic representation\\ncapability of embedding models plays a key role. This mainly\\nincludes a sparse encoder (BM25) and a dense retriever (BERT\\narchitecture Pre-training language models). Recent research\\nhas introduced prominent embedding models such as AngIE,\\nV oyage, BGE,etc [94]–[96], which are benefit from multi-task\\ninstruct tuning. Hugging Face’s MTEB leaderboard 7 evaluates\\nembedding models across 8 tasks, covering 58 datasests. Ad-\\nditionally, C-MTEB focuses on Chinese capability, covering\\n6 tasks and 35 datasets. There is no one-size-fits-all answer\\nto “which embedding model to use.” However, some specific\\nmodels are better suited for particular use cases.\\n1) Mix/hybrid Retrieval : Sparse and dense embedding\\napproaches capture different relevance features and can ben-\\nefit from each other by leveraging complementary relevance\\ninformation. For instance, sparse retrieval models can be used\\n6https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router\\n7https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard\\nto provide initial search results for training dense retrieval\\nmodels. Additionally, pre-training language models (PLMs)\\ncan be utilized to learn term weights to enhance sparse\\nretrieval. Specifically, it also demonstrates that sparse retrieval\\nmodels can enhance the zero-shot retrieval capability of dense\\nretrieval models and assist dense retrievers in handling queries\\ncontaining rare entities, thereby improving robustness.\\n2) Fine-tuning Embedding Model: In instances where the\\ncontext significantly deviates from pre-training corpus, partic-\\nularly within highly specialized disciplines such as healthcare,\\nlegal practice, and other sectors replete with proprietary jargon,\\nfine-tuning the embedding model on your own domain dataset\\nbecomes essential to mitigate such discrepancies.\\nIn addition to supplementing domain knowledge, another\\npurpose of fine-tuning is to align the retriever and generator,\\nfor example, using the results of LLM as the supervision signal\\nfor fine-tuning, known as LSR (LM-supervised Retriever).\\nPROMPTAGATOR [21] utilizes the LLM as a few-shot query\\ngenerator to create task-specific retrievers, addressing chal-\\nlenges in supervised fine-tuning, particularly in data-scarce\\ndomains. Another approach, LLM-Embedder [97], exploits\\nLLMs to generate reward signals across multiple downstream\\ntasks. The retriever is fine-tuned with two types of supervised\\nsignals: hard labels for the dataset and soft rewards from\\nthe LLMs. This dual-signal approach fosters a more effective\\nfine-tuning process, tailoring the embedding model to diverse\\ndownstream applications. REPLUG [72] utilizes a retriever\\nand an LLM to calculate the probability distributions of the\\nretrieved documents and then performs supervised training\\nby computing the KL divergence. This straightforward and\\neffective training method enhances the performance of the\\nretrieval model by using an LM as the supervisory signal,\\neliminating the need for specific cross-attention mechanisms.\\nMoreover, inspired by RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from\\nHuman Feedback), utilizing LM-based feedback to reinforce\\nthe retriever through reinforcement learning.\\nE. Adapter\\nFine-tuning models may present challenges, such as in-\\ntegrating functionality through an API or addressing con-\\nstraints arising from limited local computational resources.\\nConsequently, some approaches opt to incorporate an external\\nadapter to aid in alignment.\\nTo optimize the multi-task capabilities of LLM, UP-\\nRISE [20] trained a lightweight prompt retriever that can\\nautomatically retrieve prompts from a pre-built prompt pool\\nthat are suitable for a given zero-shot task input. AAR\\n(Augmentation-Adapted Retriver) [47] introduces a universal\\nadapter designed to accommodate multiple downstream tasks.\\nWhile PRCA [69] add a pluggable reward-driven contextual\\nadapter to enhance performance on specific tasks. BGM [26]\\nkeeps the retriever and LLM fixed,and trains a bridge Seq2Seq\\nmodel in between. The bridge model aims to transform the\\nretrieved information into a format that LLMs can work with\\neffectively, allowing it to not only rerank but also dynami-\\ncally select passages for each query, and potentially employ\\nmore advanced strategies like repetition. Furthermore, PKG'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 9, 'page_label': '10'}, page_content='10\\nintroduces an innovative method for integrating knowledge\\ninto white-box models via directive fine-tuning [75]. In this\\napproach, the retriever module is directly substituted to gen-\\nerate relevant documents according to a query. This method\\nassists in addressing the difficulties encountered during the\\nfine-tuning process and enhances model performance.\\nIV. G ENERATION\\nAfter retrieval, it is not a good practice to directly input all\\nthe retrieved information to the LLM for answering questions.\\nFollowing will introduce adjustments from two perspectives:\\nadjusting the retrieved content and adjusting the LLM.\\nA. Context Curation\\nRedundant information can interfere with the final gener-\\nation of LLM, and overly long contexts can also lead LLM\\nto the “Lost in the middle” problem [98]. Like humans, LLM\\ntends to only focus on the beginning and end of long texts,\\nwhile forgetting the middle portion. Therefore, in the RAG\\nsystem, we typically need to further process the retrieved\\ncontent.\\n1) Reranking: Reranking fundamentally reorders document\\nchunks to highlight the most pertinent results first, effectively\\nreducing the overall document pool, severing a dual purpose\\nin information retrieval, acting as both an enhancer and a\\nfilter, delivering refined inputs for more precise language\\nmodel processing [70]. Reranking can be performed using\\nrule-based methods that depend on predefined metrics like\\nDiversity, Relevance, and MRR, or model-based approaches\\nlike Encoder-Decoder models from the BERT series (e.g.,\\nSpanBERT), specialized reranking models such as Cohere\\nrerank or bge-raranker-large, and general large language mod-\\nels like GPT [12], [99].\\n2) Context Selection/Compression: A common misconcep-\\ntion in the RAG process is the belief that retrieving as many\\nrelevant documents as possible and concatenating them to form\\na lengthy retrieval prompt is beneficial. However, excessive\\ncontext can introduce more noise, diminishing the LLM’s\\nperception of key information .\\n(Long) LLMLingua [100], [101] utilize small language\\nmodels (SLMs) such as GPT-2 Small or LLaMA-7B, to\\ndetect and remove unimportant tokens, transforming it into\\na form that is challenging for humans to comprehend but\\nwell understood by LLMs. This approach presents a direct\\nand practical method for prompt compression, eliminating the\\nneed for additional training of LLMs while balancing language\\nintegrity and compression ratio. PRCA tackled this issue by\\ntraining an information extractor [69]. Similarly, RECOMP\\nadopts a comparable approach by training an information\\ncondenser using contrastive learning [71]. Each training data\\npoint consists of one positive sample and five negative sam-\\nples, and the encoder undergoes training using contrastive loss\\nthroughout this process [102] .\\nIn addition to compressing the context, reducing the num-\\nber of documents aslo helps improve the accuracy of the\\nmodel’s answers. Ma et al. [103] propose the “Filter-Reranker”\\nparadigm, which combines the strengths of LLMs and SLMs.\\nIn this paradigm, SLMs serve as filters, while LLMs function\\nas reordering agents. The research shows that instructing\\nLLMs to rearrange challenging samples identified by SLMs\\nleads to significant improvements in various Information\\nExtraction (IE) tasks. Another straightforward and effective\\napproach involves having the LLM evaluate the retrieved\\ncontent before generating the final answer. This allows the\\nLLM to filter out documents with poor relevance through LLM\\ncritique. For instance, in Chatlaw [104], the LLM is prompted\\nto self-suggestion on the referenced legal provisions to assess\\ntheir relevance.\\nB. LLM Fine-tuning\\nTargeted fine-tuning based on the scenario and data char-\\nacteristics on LLMs can yield better results. This is also one\\nof the greatest advantages of using on-premise LLMs. When\\nLLMs lack data in a specific domain, additional knowledge can\\nbe provided to the LLM through fine-tuning. Huggingface’s\\nfine-tuning data can also be used as an initial step.\\nAnother benefit of fine-tuning is the ability to adjust the\\nmodel’s input and output. For example, it can enable LLM to\\nadapt to specific data formats and generate responses in a par-\\nticular style as instructed [37]. For retrieval tasks that engage\\nwith structured data, the SANTA framework [76] implements\\na tripartite training regimen to effectively encapsulate both\\nstructural and semantic nuances. The initial phase focuses on\\nthe retriever, where contrastive learning is harnessed to refine\\nthe query and document embeddings.\\nAligning LLM outputs with human or retriever preferences\\nthrough reinforcement learning is a potential approach. For\\ninstance, manually annotating the final generated answers\\nand then providing feedback through reinforcement learning.\\nIn addition to aligning with human preferences, it is also\\npossible to align with the preferences of fine-tuned models\\nand retrievers [79]. When circumstances prevent access to\\npowerful proprietary models or larger parameter open-source\\nmodels, a simple and effective method is to distill the more\\npowerful models(e.g. GPT-4). Fine-tuning of LLM can also\\nbe coordinated with fine-tuning of the retriever to align pref-\\nerences. A typical approach, such as RA-DIT [27], aligns the\\nscoring functions between Retriever and Generator using KL\\ndivergence.\\nV. A UGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG\\nIn the domain of RAG, the standard practice often involves\\na singular (once) retrieval step followed by generation, which\\ncan lead to inefficiencies and sometimes is typically insuffi-\\ncient for complex problems demanding multi-step reasoning,\\nas it provides a limited scope of information [105]. Many\\nstudies have optimized the retrieval process in response to this\\nissue, and we have summarised them in Figure 5.\\nA. Iterative Retrieval\\nIterative retrieval is a process where the knowledge base\\nis repeatedly searched based on the initial query and the text\\ngenerated so far, providing a more comprehensive knowledge'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 10, 'page_label': '11'}, page_content='11\\nFig. 5. In addition to the most common once retrieval, RAG also includes three types of retrieval augmentation processes. (left) Iterative retrieval involves\\nalternating between retrieval and generation, allowing for richer and more targeted context from the knowledge base at each step. (Middle) Recursive retrieval\\ninvolves gradually refining the user query and breaking down the problem into sub-problems, then continuously solving complex problems through retrieval\\nand generation. (Right) Adaptive retrieval focuses on enabling the RAG system to autonomously determine whether external knowledge retrieval is necessary\\nand when to stop retrieval and generation, often utilizing LLM-generated special tokens for control.\\nbase for LLMs. This approach has been shown to enhance\\nthe robustness of subsequent answer generation by offering\\nadditional contextual references through multiple retrieval\\niterations. However, it may be affected by semantic discon-\\ntinuity and the accumulation of irrelevant information. ITER-\\nRETGEN [14] employs a synergistic approach that lever-\\nages “retrieval-enhanced generation” alongside “generation-\\nenhanced retrieval” for tasks that necessitate the reproduction\\nof specific information. The model harnesses the content\\nrequired to address the input task as a contextual basis for\\nretrieving pertinent knowledge, which in turn facilitates the\\ngeneration of improved responses in subsequent iterations.\\nB. Recursive Retrieval\\nRecursive retrieval is often used in information retrieval and\\nNLP to improve the depth and relevance of search results.\\nThe process involves iteratively refining search queries based\\non the results obtained from previous searches. Recursive\\nRetrieval aims to enhance the search experience by gradu-\\nally converging on the most pertinent information through a\\nfeedback loop. IRCoT [61] uses chain-of-thought to guide\\nthe retrieval process and refines the CoT with the obtained\\nretrieval results. ToC [57] creates a clarification tree that\\nsystematically optimizes the ambiguous parts in the Query. It\\ncan be particularly useful in complex search scenarios where\\nthe user’s needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where\\nthe information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. The\\nrecursive nature of the process allows for continuous learning\\nand adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in\\nimproved satisfaction with the search outcomes.\\nTo address specific data scenarios, recursive retrieval and\\nmulti-hop retrieval techniques are utilized together. Recursive\\nretrieval involves a structured index to process and retrieve\\ndata in a hierarchical manner, which may include summarizing\\nsections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a\\nretrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary\\nretrieval within the document refines the search, embodying\\nthe recursive nature of the process. In contrast, multi-hop\\nretrieval is designed to delve deeper into graph-structured data\\nsources, extracting interconnected information [106].\\nC. Adaptive Retrieval\\nAdaptive retrieval methods, exemplified by Flare [24] and\\nSelf-RAG [25], refine the RAG framework by enabling LLMs\\nto actively determine the optimal moments and content for\\nretrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the\\ninformation sourced.\\nThese methods are part of a broader trend wherein\\nLLMs employ active judgment in their operations, as seen\\nin model agents like AutoGPT, Toolformer, and Graph-\\nToolformer [107]–[109]. Graph-Toolformer, for instance, di-\\nvides its retrieval process into distinct steps where LLMs\\nproactively use retrievers, apply Self-Ask techniques, and em-\\nploy few-shot prompts to initiate search queries. This proactive\\nstance allows LLMs to decide when to search for necessary\\ninformation, akin to how an agent utilizes tools.\\nWebGPT [110] integrates a reinforcement learning frame-\\nwork to train the GPT-3 model in autonomously using a\\nsearch engine during text generation. It navigates this process\\nusing special tokens that facilitate actions such as search\\nengine queries, browsing results, and citing references, thereby\\nexpanding GPT-3’s capabilities through the use of external\\nsearch engines. Flare automates timing retrieval by monitoring\\nthe confidence of the generation process, as indicated by the'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 11, 'page_label': '12'}, page_content='12\\nprobability of generated terms [24]. When the probability falls\\nbelow a certain threshold would activates the retrieval system\\nto collect relevant information, thus optimizing the retrieval\\ncycle. Self-RAG [25] introduces “reflection tokens” that allow\\nthe model to introspect its outputs. These tokens come in\\ntwo varieties: “retrieve” and “critic”. The model autonomously\\ndecides when to activate retrieval, or alternatively, a predefined\\nthreshold may trigger the process. During retrieval, the gen-\\nerator conducts a fragment-level beam search across multiple\\nparagraphs to derive the most coherent sequence. Critic scores\\nare used to update the subdivision scores, with the flexibility\\nto adjust these weights during inference, tailoring the model’s\\nbehavior. Self-RAG’s design obviates the need for additional\\nclassifiers or reliance on Natural Language Inference (NLI)\\nmodels, thus streamlining the decision-making process for\\nwhen to engage retrieval mechanisms and improving the\\nmodel’s autonomous judgment capabilities in generating ac-\\ncurate responses.\\nVI. T ASK AND EVALUATION\\nThe rapid advancement and growing adoption of RAG\\nin the field of NLP have propelled the evaluation of RAG\\nmodels to the forefront of research in the LLMs community.\\nThe primary objective of this evaluation is to comprehend\\nand optimize the performance of RAG models across diverse\\napplication scenarios.This chapter will mainly introduce the\\nmain downstream tasks of RAG, datasets, and how to evaluate\\nRAG systems.\\nA. Downstream Task\\nThe core task of RAG remains Question Answering (QA),\\nincluding traditional single-hop/multi-hop QA, multiple-\\nchoice, domain-specific QA as well as long-form scenarios\\nsuitable for RAG. In addition to QA, RAG is continuously\\nbeing expanded into multiple downstream tasks, such as Infor-\\nmation Extraction (IE), dialogue generation, code search, etc.\\nThe main downstream tasks of RAG and their corresponding\\ndatasets are summarized in Table II.\\nB. Evaluation Target\\nHistorically, RAG models assessments have centered on\\ntheir execution in specific downstream tasks. These evaluations\\nemploy established metrics suitable to the tasks at hand. For\\ninstance, question answering evaluations might rely on EM\\nand F1 scores [7], [45], [59], [72], whereas fact-checking\\ntasks often hinge on Accuracy as the primary metric [4],\\n[14], [42]. BLEU and ROUGE metrics are also commonly\\nused to evaluate answer quality [26], [32], [52], [78]. Tools\\nlike RALLE, designed for the automatic evaluation of RAG\\napplications, similarly base their assessments on these task-\\nspecific metrics [160]. Despite this, there is a notable paucity\\nof research dedicated to evaluating the distinct characteristics\\nof RAG models.The main evaluation objectives include:\\nRetrieval Quality. Evaluating the retrieval quality is crucial\\nfor determining the effectiveness of the context sourced by\\nthe retriever component. Standard metrics from the domains\\nof search engines, recommendation systems, and information\\nretrieval systems are employed to measure the performance of\\nthe RAG retrieval module. Metrics such as Hit Rate, MRR, and\\nNDCG are commonly utilized for this purpose [161], [162].\\nGeneration Quality . The assessment of generation quality\\ncenters on the generator’s capacity to synthesize coherent and\\nrelevant answers from the retrieved context. This evaluation\\ncan be categorized based on the content’s objectives: unlabeled\\nand labeled content. For unlabeled content, the evaluation\\nencompasses the faithfulness, relevance, and non-harmfulness\\nof the generated answers. In contrast, for labeled content,\\nthe focus is on the accuracy of the information produced by\\nthe model [161]. Additionally, both retrieval and generation\\nquality assessments can be conducted through manual or\\nautomatic evaluation methods [29], [161], [163].\\nC. Evaluation Aspects\\nContemporary evaluation practices of RAG models empha-\\nsize three primary quality scores and four essential abilities,\\nwhich collectively inform the evaluation of the two principal\\ntargets of the RAG model: retrieval and generation.\\n1) Quality Scores: Quality scores include context rele-\\nvance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. These qual-\\nity scores evaluate the efficiency of the RAG model from\\ndifferent perspectives in the process of information retrieval\\nand generation [164]–[166].\\nContext Relevance evaluates the precision and specificity\\nof the retrieved context, ensuring relevance and minimizing\\nprocessing costs associated with extraneous content.\\nAnswer Faithfulness ensures that the generated answers\\nremain true to the retrieved context, maintaining consistency\\nand avoiding contradictions.\\nAnswer Relevance requires that the generated answers are\\ndirectly pertinent to the posed questions, effectively addressing\\nthe core inquiry.\\n2) Required Abilities: RAG evaluation also encompasses\\nfour abilities indicative of its adaptability and efficiency:\\nnoise robustness, negative rejection, information integration,\\nand counterfactual robustness [167], [168]. These abilities are\\ncritical for the model’s performance under various challenges\\nand complex scenarios, impacting the quality scores.\\nNoise Robustness appraises the model’s capability to man-\\nage noise documents that are question-related but lack sub-\\nstantive information.\\nNegative Rejection assesses the model’s discernment in\\nrefraining from responding when the retrieved documents do\\nnot contain the necessary knowledge to answer a question.\\nInformation Integration evaluates the model’s proficiency in\\nsynthesizing information from multiple documents to address\\ncomplex questions.\\nCounterfactual Robustness tests the model’s ability to rec-\\nognize and disregard known inaccuracies within documents,\\neven when instructed about potential misinformation.\\nContext relevance and noise robustness are important for\\nevaluating the quality of retrieval, while answer faithfulness,\\nanswer relevance, negative rejection, information integration,\\nand counterfactual robustness are important for evaluating the\\nquality of generation.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 12, 'page_label': '13'}, page_content='13\\nTABLE II\\nDOWNSTREAM TASKS AND DATASETS OF RAG\\nTask Sub Task Dataset Method\\nQA Single-hop Natural Qustion(NQ) [111]\\n[26], [30], [34], [42], [45], [50], [52], [59], [64], [82]\\n[3], [4], [22], [27], [40], [43], [54], [62], [71], [112]\\n[20], [44], [72]\\nTriviaQA(TQA) [113]\\n[13], [30], [34], [45], [50], [64]\\n[4], [27], [59], [62], [112]\\n[22], [25], [43], [44], [71], [72]\\nSQuAD [114] [20], [23], [30], [32], [45], [69], [112]\\nWeb Questions(WebQ) [115] [3], [4], [13], [30], [50], [68]\\nPopQA [116] [7], [25], [67]\\nMS MARCO [117] [4], [40], [52]\\nMulti-hop HotpotQA [118] [23], [26], [31], [34], [47], [51], [61], [82]\\n[7], [14], [22], [27], [59], [62], [69], [71], [91]\\n2WikiMultiHopQA [119] [14], [24], [48], [59], [61], [91]\\nMuSiQue [120] [14], [51], [61], [91]\\nLong-form QA ELI5 [121] [27], [34], [43], [49], [51]\\nNarrativeQA(NQA) [122] [45], [60], [63], [123]\\nASQA [124] [24], [57]\\nQMSum(QM) [125] [60], [123]\\nDomain QA Qasper [126] [60], [63]\\nCOVID-QA [127] [35], [46]\\nCMB [128],MMCU Medical [129] [81]\\nMulti-Choice QA QuALITY [130] [60], [63]\\nARC [131] [25], [67]\\nCommonsenseQA [132] [58], [66]\\nGraph QA GraphQA [84] [84]\\nDialog Dialog Generation Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW) [133] [13], [27], [34], [42]\\nPersonal Dialog KBP [134] [74], [135]\\nDuleMon [136] [74]\\nTask-oriented Dialog CamRest [137] [78], [79]\\nRecommendation Amazon(Toys,Sport,Beauty) [138] [39], [40]\\nIE Event Argument Extraction WikiEvent [139] [13], [27], [37], [42]\\nRAMS [140] [36], [37]\\nRelation Extraction T-REx [141],ZsRE [142] [27], [51]\\nReasoning Commonsense Reasoning HellaSwag [143] [20], [66]\\nCoT Reasoning CoT Reasoning [144] [27]\\nComplex Reasoning CSQA [145] [55]\\nOthers Language Understanding MMLU [146] [7], [27], [28], [42], [43], [47], [72]\\nLanguage Modeling WikiText-103 [147] [5], [29], [64], [71]\\nStrategyQA [148] [14], [24], [48], [51], [55], [58]\\nFact Checking/Verification FEVER [149] [4], [13], [27], [34], [42], [50]\\nPubHealth [150] [25], [67]\\nText Generation Biography [151] [67]\\nText Summarization WikiASP [152] [24]\\nXSum [153] [17]\\nText Classification VioLens [154] [19]\\nTREC [155] [33]\\nSentiment SST-2 [156] [20], [33], [38]\\nCode Search CodeSearchNet [157] [76]\\nRobustness Evaluation NoMIRACL [56] [56]\\nMath GSM8K [158] [73]\\nMachine Translation JRC-Acquis [159] [17]'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 13, 'page_label': '14'}, page_content='14\\nTABLE III\\nSUMMARY OF METRICS APPLICABLE FOR EVALUATION ASPECTS OF RAG\\nContext\\nRelevance Faithfulness Answer\\nRelevance\\nNoise\\nRobustness\\nNegative\\nRejection\\nInformation\\nIntegration\\nCounterfactual\\nRobustness\\nAccuracy ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓\\nEM ✓\\nRecall ✓\\nPrecision ✓ ✓\\nR-Rate ✓\\nCosine Similarity ✓\\nHit Rate ✓\\nMRR ✓\\nNDCG ✓\\nBLEU ✓ ✓ ✓\\nROUGE/ROUGE-L ✓ ✓ ✓\\nThe specific metrics for each evaluation aspect are sum-\\nmarized in Table III.

Custom metrics tailored\\nto the nuances of RAG models, though not included here, have\\nalso been developed in some evaluation studies.\\nD. Evaluation Benchmarks and Tools\\nA series of benchmark tests and tools have been proposed\\nto facilitate the evaluation of RAG.These instruments furnish\\nquantitative metrics that not only gauge RAG model perfor-\\nmance but also enhance comprehension of the model’s capabil-\\nities across various evaluation aspects. Prominent benchmarks\\nsuch as RGB, RECALL and CRUD [167]–[169] focus on\\nappraising the essential abilities of RAG models. Concur-\\nrently, state-of-the-art automated tools like RAGAS [164],\\nARES [165], and TruLens 8 employ LLMs to adjudicate the\\nquality scores. These tools and benchmarks collectively form\\na robust framework for the systematic evaluation of RAG\\nmodels, as summarized in Table IV.\\nVII. D ISCUSSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS\\nDespite the considerable progress in RAG technology, sev-\\neral challenges persist that warrant in-depth research.This\\nchapter will mainly introduce the current challenges and future\\nresearch directions faced by RAG.\\nA. RAG vs Long Context\\nWith the deepening of related research, the context of LLMs\\nis continuously expanding [170]–[172]. Presently, LLMs can\\neffortlessly manage contexts exceeding 200,000 tokens 9. This\\ncapability signifies that long-document question answering,\\npreviously reliant on RAG, can now incorporate the entire\\ndocument directly into the prompt. This has also sparked\\ndiscussions on whether RAG is still necessary when LLMs\\n8https://www.trulens.org/trulens eval/core concepts rag triad/\\n9https://kimi.moonshot.cn\\nare not constrained by context. In fact, RAG still plays an\\nirreplaceable role. On one hand, providing LLMs with a\\nlarge amount of context at once will significantly impact its\\ninference speed, while chunked retrieval and on-demand input\\ncan significantly improve operational efficiency. On the other\\nhand, RAG-based generation can quickly locate the original\\nreferences for LLMs to help users verify the generated an-\\nswers. The entire retrieval and reasoning process is observable,\\nwhile generation solely relying on long context remains a\\nblack box. Conversely, the expansion of context provides new\\nopportunities for the development of RAG, enabling it to\\naddress more complex problems and integrative or summary\\nquestions that require reading a large amount of material to\\nanswer [49]. Developing new RAG methods in the context of\\nsuper-long contexts is one of the future research trends.\\nB. RAG Robustness\\nThe presence of noise or contradictory information during\\nretrieval can detrimentally affect RAG’s output quality. This\\nsituation is figuratively referred to as “Misinformation can\\nbe worse than no information at all”. Improving RAG’s\\nresistance to such adversarial or counterfactual inputs is gain-\\ning research momentum and has become a key performance\\nmetric [48], [50], [82]. Cuconasu et al. [54] analyze which\\ntype of documents should be retrieved, evaluate the relevance\\nof the documents to the prompt, their position, and the\\nnumber included in the context. The research findings reveal\\nthat including irrelevant documents can unexpectedly increase\\naccuracy by over 30%, contradicting the initial assumption\\nof reduced quality. These results underscore the importance\\nof developing specialized strategies to integrate retrieval with\\nlanguage generation models, highlighting the need for further\\nresearch and exploration into the robustness of RAG.\\nC.

Readers are encouraged to consult pertinent literature for the specific quantification formulas associated with these\\nmetrics, as required.\\nand non-parameterized advantages are areas ripe for explo-\\nration [27]. Another trend is to introduce SLMs with specific\\nfunctionalities into RAG and fine-tuned by the results of RAG\\nsystem. For example, CRAG [67] trains a lightweight retrieval\\nevaluator to assess the overall quality of the retrieved docu-\\nments for a query and triggers different knowledge retrieval\\nactions based on confidence levels.\\nD. Scaling laws of RAG\\nEnd-to-end RAG models and pre-trained models based\\non RAG are still one of the focuses of current re-\\nsearchers [173].The parameters of these models are one of\\nthe key factors.While scaling laws [174] are established for\\nLLMs, their applicability to RAG remains uncertain. Initial\\nstudies like RETRO++ [44] have begun to address this, yet the\\nparameter count in RAG models still lags behind that of LLMs.\\nThe possibility of an Inverse Scaling Law 10, where smaller\\nmodels outperform larger ones, is particularly intriguing and\\nmerits further investigation.\\nE. Production-Ready RAG\\nRAG’s practicality and alignment with engineering require-\\nments have facilitated its adoption. However, enhancing re-\\ntrieval efficiency, improving document recall in large knowl-\\nedge bases, and ensuring data security—such as preventing\\n10https://github.com/inverse-scaling/prize\\ninadvertent disclosure of document sources or metadata by\\nLLMs—are critical engineering challenges that remain to be\\naddressed [175].\\nThe development of the RAG ecosystem is greatly impacted\\nby the progression of its technical stack. Key tools like\\nLangChain and LLamaIndex have quickly gained popularity\\nwith the emergence of ChatGPT, providing extensive RAG-\\nrelated APIs and becoming essential in the realm of LLMs.The\\nemerging technology stack, while not as rich in features as\\nLangChain and LLamaIndex, stands out through its specialized\\nproducts. For example, Flowise AI prioritizes a low-code\\napproach, allowing users to deploy AI applications, including\\nRAG, through a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. Other\\ntechnologies like HayStack, Meltano, and Cohere Coral are\\nalso gaining attention for their unique contributions to the field.\\nIn addition to AI-focused vendors, traditional software and\\ncloud service providers are expanding their offerings to include\\nRAG-centric services. Weaviate’s Verba 11 is designed for\\npersonal assistant applications, while Amazon’s Kendra 12\\noffers intelligent enterprise search services, enabling users to\\nbrowse various content repositories using built-in connectors.\\nIn the development of RAG technology, there is a clear\\ntrend towards different specialization directions, such as: 1)\\nCustomization - tailoring RAG to meet specific requirements.\\n2) Simplification - making RAG easier to use to reduce the\\n11https://github.com/weaviate/Verba\\n12https://aws.amazon.com/cn/kendra/'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 15, 'page_label': '16'}, page_content='16\\nFig. 6.

However, a fully integrated,\\ncomprehensive platform concept is still in the future, requiring\\nfurther innovation and development.\\nF . Multi-modal RAG\\nRAG has transcended its initial text-based question-\\nanswering confines, embracing a diverse array of modal data.\\nThis expansion has spawned innovative multimodal models\\nthat integrate RAG concepts across various domains:\\nImage. RA-CM3 [176] stands as a pioneering multimodal\\nmodel of both retrieving and generating text and images.\\nBLIP-2 [177] leverages frozen image encoders alongside\\nLLMs for efficient visual language pre-training, enabling zero-\\nshot image-to-text conversions. The “Visualize Before You\\nWrite” method [178] employs image generation to steer the\\nLM’s text generation, showing promise in open-ended text\\ngeneration tasks.\\nAudio and Video . The GSS method retrieves and stitches\\ntogether audio clips to convert machine-translated data into\\nspeech-translated data [179]. UEOP marks a significant ad-\\nvancement in end-to-end automatic speech recognition by\\nincorporating external, offline strategies for voice-to-text con-\\nversion [180]. Additionally, KNN-based attention fusion lever-\\nages audio embeddings and semantically related text embed-\\ndings to refine ASR, thereby accelerating domain adaptation.\\nVid2Seq augments language models with specialized temporal\\nmarkers, facilitating the prediction of event boundaries and\\ntextual descriptions within a unified output sequence [181].\\nCode. RBPS [182] excels in small-scale learning tasks by\\nretrieving code examples that align with developers’ objectives\\nthrough encoding and frequency analysis. This approach has\\ndemonstrated efficacy in tasks such as test assertion genera-\\ntion and program repair. For structured knowledge, the CoK\\nmethod [106] first extracts facts pertinent to the input query\\nfrom a knowledge graph, then integrates these facts as hints\\nwithin the input, enhancing performance in knowledge graph\\nquestion-answering tasks.\\nVIII. C ONCLUSION\\nThe summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 6, empha-\\nsizes RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the capa-\\nbilities of LLMs by integrating parameterized knowledge from\\nlanguage models with extensive non-parameterized data from\\nexternal knowledge bases.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\attention.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\attention.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\n Multi-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\attention.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention O(n2 · d) O(1) O(1)\\nRecurrent O(n · d2) O(n) O(n)\\nConvolutional O(k · n · d2) O(1) O(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r · n · d) O(1) O(n/r)\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-04-10T21:11:43+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\attention.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}, page_content='Table 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FR\\nByteNet [18] 23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39] 39.2 1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38] 24.6 39.92 2.3 · 1019 1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9] 25.16 40.46 9.6 · 1018 1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32] 26.03 40.56 2.0 · 1019 1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] 40.4 8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38] 26.30 41.16 1.8 · 1020 1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9] 26.36 41.29 7.7 · 1019 1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big) 28.4 41.8 2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

O VERVIEW OF RAG\\nA typical application of RAG is illustrated in Figure 2.\\nHere, a user poses a question to ChatGPT about a recent,\\nwidely discussed news. Given ChatGPT’s reliance on pre-\\ntraining data, it initially lacks the capacity to provide up-\\ndates on recent developments. RAG bridges this information\\ngap by sourcing and incorporating knowledge from external\\ndatabases. In this case, it gathers relevant news articles related\\nto the user’s query. These articles, combined with the original\\nquestion, form a comprehensive prompt that empowers LLMs\\nto generate a well-informed answer.\\nThe RAG research paradigm is continuously evolving, and\\nwe categorize it into three stages: Naive RAG, Advanced\\nRAG, and Modular RAG, as showed in Figure 3. Despite\\nRAG method are cost-effective and surpass the performance\\nof the native LLM, they also exhibit several limitations.\\nThe development of Advanced RAG and Modular RAG is\\na response to these specific shortcomings in Naive RAG.\\nA. Naive RAG\\nThe Naive RAG research paradigm represents the earli-\\nest methodology, which gained prominence shortly after the'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='3\\nFig. 2. A representative instance of the RAG process applied to question answering. It mainly consists of 3 steps. 1) Indexing. Documents are split into chunks,\\nencoded into vectors, and stored in a vector database. 2) Retrieval. Retrieve the Top k chunks most relevant to the question based on semantic similarity. 3)\\nGeneration. Input the original question and the retrieved chunks together into LLM to generate the final answer.\\nwidespread adoption of ChatGPT. The Naive RAG follows\\na traditional process that includes indexing, retrieval, and\\ngeneration, which is also characterized as a “Retrieve-Read”\\nframework [7].\\nIndexing starts with the cleaning and extraction of raw data\\nin diverse formats like PDF, HTML, Word, and Markdown,\\nwhich is then converted into a uniform plain text format. To\\naccommodate the context limitations of language models, text\\nis segmented into smaller, digestible chunks. Chunks are then\\nencoded into vector representations using an embedding model\\nand stored in vector database. This step is crucial for enabling\\nefficient similarity searches in the subsequent retrieval phase.\\nRetrieval. Upon receipt of a user query, the RAG system\\nemploys the same encoding model utilized during the indexing\\nphase to transform the query into a vector representation.\\nIt then computes the similarity scores between the query\\nvector and the vector of chunks within the indexed corpus.\\nThe system prioritizes and retrieves the top K chunks that\\ndemonstrate the greatest similarity to the query. These chunks\\nare subsequently used as the expanded context in prompt.\\nGeneration. The posed query and selected documents are\\nsynthesized into a coherent prompt to which a large language\\nmodel is tasked with formulating a response. The model’s\\napproach to answering may vary depending on task-specific\\ncriteria, allowing it to either draw upon its inherent parametric\\nknowledge or restrict its responses to the information con-\\ntained within the provided documents. In cases of ongoing\\ndialogues, any existing conversational history can be integrated\\ninto the prompt, enabling the model to engage in multi-turn\\ndialogue interactions effectively.\\nHowever, Naive RAG encounters notable drawbacks:\\nRetrieval Challenges . The retrieval phase often struggles\\nwith precision and recall, leading to the selection of misaligned\\nor irrelevant chunks, and the missing of crucial information.\\nGeneration Difficulties. In generating responses, the model\\nmay face the issue of hallucination, where it produces con-\\ntent not supported by the retrieved context. This phase can\\nalso suffer from irrelevance, toxicity, or bias in the outputs,\\ndetracting from the quality and reliability of the responses.\\nAugmentation Hurdles . Integrating retrieved information\\nwith the different task can be challenging, sometimes resulting\\nin disjointed or incoherent outputs. The process may also\\nencounter redundancy when similar information is retrieved\\nfrom multiple sources, leading to repetitive responses. Deter-\\nmining the significance and relevance of various passages and\\nensuring stylistic and tonal consistency add further complexity.\\nFacing complex issues, a single retrieval based on the original\\nquery may not suffice to acquire adequate context information.\\nMoreover, there’s a concern that generation models might\\noverly rely on augmented information, leading to outputs that\\nsimply echo retrieved content without adding insightful or\\nsynthesized information.\\nB. Advanced RAG\\nAdvanced RAG introduces specific improvements to over-\\ncome the limitations of Naive RAG. Focusing on enhancing re-\\ntrieval quality, it employs pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strate-\\ngies. To tackle the indexing issues, Advanced RAG refines\\nits indexing techniques through the use of a sliding window\\napproach, fine-grained segmentation, and the incorporation of\\nmetadata. Additionally, it incorporates several optimization\\nmethods to streamline the retrieval process [8].'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='4\\nFig. 3. Comparison between the three paradigms of RAG. (Left) Naive RAG mainly consists of three parts: indexing, retrieval and generation. (Middle)\\nAdvanced RAG proposes multiple optimization strategies around pre-retrieval and post-retrieval, with a process similar to the Naive RAG, still following a\\nchain-like structure. (Right) Modular RAG inherits and develops from the previous paradigm, showcasing greater flexibility overall. This is evident in the\\nintroduction of multiple specific functional modules and the replacement of existing modules. The overall process is not limited to sequential retrieval and\\ngeneration; it includes methods such as iterative and adaptive retrieval.\\nPre-retrieval process. In this stage, the primary focus is\\non optimizing the indexing structure and the original query.\\nThe goal of optimizing indexing is to enhance the quality of\\nthe content being indexed. This involves strategies: enhancing\\ndata granularity, optimizing index structures, adding metadata,\\nalignment optimization, and mixed retrieval. While the goal\\nof query optimization is to make the user’s original question\\nclearer and more suitable for the retrieval task. Common\\nmethods include query rewriting query transformation, query\\nexpansion and other techniques [7], [9]–[11].\\nPost-Retrieval Process. Once relevant context is retrieved,\\nit’s crucial to integrate it effectively with the query. The main\\nmethods in post-retrieval process include rerank chunks and\\ncontext compressing. Re-ranking the retrieved information to\\nrelocate the most relevant content to the edges of the prompt is\\na key strategy. This concept has been implemented in frame-\\nworks such as LlamaIndex 2, LangChain3, and HayStack [12].\\nFeeding all relevant documents directly into LLMs can lead\\nto information overload, diluting the focus on key details with\\nirrelevant content.To mitigate this, post-retrieval efforts con-\\ncentrate on selecting the essential information, emphasizing\\ncritical sections, and shortening the context to be processed.\\n2https://www.llamaindex.ai\\n3https://www.langchain.com/\\nC. Modular RAG\\nThe modular RAG architecture advances beyond the for-\\nmer two RAG paradigms, offering enhanced adaptability and\\nversatility. It incorporates diverse strategies for improving its\\ncomponents, such as adding a search module for similarity\\nsearches and refining the retriever through fine-tuning. Inno-\\nvations like restructured RAG modules [13] and rearranged\\nRAG pipelines [14] have been introduced to tackle specific\\nchallenges. The shift towards a modular RAG approach is\\nbecoming prevalent, supporting both sequential processing and\\nintegrated end-to-end training across its components. Despite\\nits distinctiveness, Modular RAG builds upon the foundational\\nprinciples of Advanced and Naive RAG, illustrating a progres-\\nsion and refinement within the RAG family.\\n1) New Modules: The Modular RAG framework introduces\\nadditional specialized components to enhance retrieval and\\nprocessing capabilities. The Search module adapts to spe-\\ncific scenarios, enabling direct searches across various data\\nsources like search engines, databases, and knowledge graphs,\\nusing LLM-generated code and query languages [15]. RAG-\\nFusion addresses traditional search limitations by employing\\na multi-query strategy that expands user queries into diverse\\nperspectives, utilizing parallel vector searches and intelligent\\nre-ranking to uncover both explicit and transformative knowl-\\nedge [16]. The Memory module leverages the LLM’s memory\\nto guide retrieval, creating an unbounded memory pool that'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 4, 'page_label': '5'}, page_content='5\\naligns the text more closely with data distribution through iter-\\native self-enhancement [17], [18]. Routing in the RAG system\\nnavigates through diverse data sources, selecting the optimal\\npathway for a query, whether it involves summarization,\\nspecific database searches, or merging different information\\nstreams [19]. The Predict module aims to reduce redundancy\\nand noise by generating context directly through the LLM,\\nensuring relevance and accuracy [13]. Lastly, the Task Adapter\\nmodule tailors RAG to various downstream tasks, automating\\nprompt retrieval for zero-shot inputs and creating task-specific\\nretrievers through few-shot query generation [20], [21] .This\\ncomprehensive approach not only streamlines the retrieval pro-\\ncess but also significantly improves the quality and relevance\\nof the information retrieved, catering to a wide array of tasks\\nand queries with enhanced precision and flexibility.\\n2) New Patterns: Modular RAG offers remarkable adapt-\\nability by allowing module substitution or reconfiguration\\nto address specific challenges. This goes beyond the fixed\\nstructures of Naive and Advanced RAG, characterized by a\\nsimple “Retrieve” and “Read” mechanism. Moreover, Modular\\nRAG expands this flexibility by integrating new modules or\\nadjusting interaction flow among existing ones, enhancing its\\napplicability across different tasks.\\nInnovations such as the Rewrite-Retrieve-Read [7]model\\nleverage the LLM’s capabilities to refine retrieval queries\\nthrough a rewriting module and a LM-feedback mechanism\\nto update rewriting model., improving task performance.\\nSimilarly, approaches like Generate-Read [13] replace tradi-\\ntional retrieval with LLM-generated content, while Recite-\\nRead [22] emphasizes retrieval from model weights, enhanc-\\ning the model’s ability to handle knowledge-intensive tasks.\\nHybrid retrieval strategies integrate keyword, semantic, and\\nvector searches to cater to diverse queries. Additionally, em-\\nploying sub-queries and hypothetical document embeddings\\n(HyDE) [11] seeks to improve retrieval relevance by focusing\\non embedding similarities between generated answers and real\\ndocuments.\\nAdjustments in module arrangement and interaction, such\\nas the Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) [23] framework\\nand the iterative Retrieve-Read-Retrieve-Read flow of ITER-\\nRETGEN [14], showcase the dynamic use of module out-\\nputs to bolster another module’s functionality, illustrating a\\nsophisticated understanding of enhancing module synergy.\\nThe flexible orchestration of Modular RAG Flow showcases\\nthe benefits of adaptive retrieval through techniques such as\\nFLARE [24] and Self-RAG [25]. This approach transcends\\nthe fixed RAG retrieval process by evaluating the necessity\\nof retrieval based on different scenarios. Another benefit of\\na flexible architecture is that the RAG system can more\\neasily integrate with other technologies (such as fine-tuning\\nor reinforcement learning) [26]. For example, this can involve\\nfine-tuning the retriever for better retrieval results, fine-tuning\\nthe generator for more personalized outputs, or engaging in\\ncollaborative fine-tuning [27].\\nD. RAG vs Fine-tuning\\nThe augmentation of LLMs has attracted considerable atten-\\ntion due to their growing prevalence. Among the optimization\\nmethods for LLMs, RAG is often compared with Fine-tuning\\n(FT) and prompt engineering. Each method has distinct charac-\\nteristics as illustrated in Figure 4. We used a quadrant chart to\\nillustrate the differences among three methods in two dimen-\\nsions: external knowledge requirements and model adaption\\nrequirements. Prompt engineering leverages a model’s inherent\\ncapabilities with minimum necessity for external knowledge\\nand model adaption. RAG can be likened to providing a model\\nwith a tailored textbook for information retrieval, ideal for pre-\\ncise information retrieval tasks. In contrast, FT is comparable\\nto a student internalizing knowledge over time, suitable for\\nscenarios requiring replication of specific structures, styles, or\\nformats.\\nRAG excels in dynamic environments by offering real-\\ntime knowledge updates and effective utilization of external\\nknowledge sources with high interpretability. However, it\\ncomes with higher latency and ethical considerations regarding\\ndata retrieval. On the other hand, FT is more static, requiring\\nretraining for updates but enabling deep customization of the\\nmodel’s behavior and style. It demands significant compu-\\ntational resources for dataset preparation and training, and\\nwhile it can reduce hallucinations, it may face challenges with\\nunfamiliar data.\\nIn multiple evaluations of their performance on various\\nknowledge-intensive tasks across different topics, [28] re-\\nvealed that while unsupervised fine-tuning shows some im-\\nprovement, RAG consistently outperforms it, for both exist-\\ning knowledge encountered during training and entirely new\\nknowledge. Additionally, it was found that LLMs struggle\\nto learn new factual information through unsupervised fine-\\ntuning. The choice between RAG and FT depends on the\\nspecific needs for data dynamics, customization, and com-\\nputational capabilities in the application context. RAG and\\nFT are not mutually exclusive and can complement each\\nother, enhancing a model’s capabilities at different levels.\\nIn some instances, their combined use may lead to optimal\\nperformance. The optimization process involving RAG and FT\\nmay require multiple iterations to achieve satisfactory results.\\nIII. R ETRIEVAL\\nIn the context of RAG, it is crucial to efficiently retrieve\\nrelevant documents from the data source. There are several\\nkey issues involved, such as the retrieval source, retrieval\\ngranularity, pre-processing of the retrieval, and selection of\\nthe corresponding embedding model.\\nA. Retrieval Source\\nRAG relies on external knowledge to enhance LLMs, while\\nthe type of retrieval source and the granularity of retrieval\\nunits both affect the final generation results.\\n1) Data Structure: Initially, text is s the mainstream source\\nof retrieval. Subsequently, the retrieval source expanded to in-\\nclude semi-structured data (PDF) and structured data (Knowl-\\nedge Graph, KG) for enhancement. In addition to retrieving\\nfrom original external sources, there is also a growing trend in\\nrecent researches towards utilizing content generated by LLMs\\nthemselves for retrieval and enhancement

RAG compared with other model optimization methods in the aspects of “External Knowledge Required” and “Model Adaption Required”. Prompt\\nEngineering requires low modifications to the model and external knowledge, focusing on harnessing the capabilities of LLMs themselves. Fine-tuning, on\\nthe other hand, involves further training the model. In the early stages of RAG (Naive RAG), there is a low demand for model modifications. As research\\nprogresses, Modular RAG has become more integrated with fine-tuning techniques.\\nUnstructured Data , such as text, is the most widely used\\nretrieval source, which are mainly gathered from corpus. For\\nopen-domain question-answering (ODQA) tasks, the primary\\nretrieval sources are Wikipedia Dump with the current major\\nversions including HotpotQA 4 (1st October , 2017), DPR5 (20\\nDecember, 2018). In addition to encyclopedic data, common\\nunstructured data includes cross-lingual text [19] and domain-\\nspecific data (such as medical [67]and legal domains [29]).\\nSemi-structured data. typically refers to data that contains a\\ncombination of text and table information, such as PDF. Han-\\ndling semi-structured data poses challenges for conventional\\nRAG systems due to two main reasons. Firstly, text splitting\\nprocesses may inadvertently separate tables, leading to data\\ncorruption during retrieval. Secondly, incorporating tables into\\nthe data can complicate semantic similarity searches. When\\ndealing with semi-structured data, one approach involves lever-\\naging the code capabilities of LLMs to execute Text-2-SQL\\nqueries on tables within databases, such as TableGPT [85].\\nAlternatively, tables can be transformed into text format for\\nfurther analysis using text-based methods [75]. However, both\\nof these methods are not optimal solutions, indicating substan-\\ntial research opportunities in this area.\\nStructured data , such as knowledge graphs (KGs) [86] ,\\nwhich are typically verified and can provide more precise in-\\nformation. KnowledGPT [15] generates KB search queries and\\nstores knowledge in a personalized base, enhancing the RAG\\nmodel’s knowledge richness. In response to the limitations of\\nLLMs in understanding and answering questions about textual\\ngraphs, G-Retriever [84] integrates Graph Neural Networks\\n4https://hotpotqa.github.io/wiki-readme.html\\n5https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR\\n(GNNs), LLMs and RAG, enhancing graph comprehension\\nand question-answering capabilities through soft prompting\\nof the LLM, and employs the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree\\n(PCST) optimization problem for targeted graph retrieval. On\\nthe contrary, it requires additional effort to build, validate,\\nand maintain structured databases. On the contrary, it requires\\nadditional effort to build, validate, and maintain structured\\ndatabases.\\nLLMs-Generated Content. Addressing the limitations of\\nexternal auxiliary information in RAG, some research has\\nfocused on exploiting LLMs’ internal knowledge. SKR [58]\\nclassifies questions as known or unknown, applying retrieval\\nenhancement selectively. GenRead [13] replaces the retriever\\nwith an LLM generator, finding that LLM-generated contexts\\noften contain more accurate answers due to better alignment\\nwith the pre-training objectives of causal language modeling.\\nSelfmem [17] iteratively creates an unbounded memory pool\\nwith a retrieval-enhanced generator, using a memory selec-\\ntor to choose outputs that serve as dual problems to the\\noriginal question, thus self-enhancing the generative model.\\nThese methodologies underscore the breadth of innovative\\ndata source utilization in RAG, striving to improve model\\nperformance and task effectiveness.\\n2) Retrieval Granularity: Another important factor besides\\nthe data format of the retrieval source is the granularity of\\nthe retrieved data. Coarse-grained retrieval units theoretically\\ncan provide more relevant information for the problem, but\\nthey may also contain redundant content, which could distract\\nthe retriever and language models in downstream tasks [50],\\n[87]. On the other hand, fine-grained retrieval unit granularity\\nincreases the burden of retrieval and does not guarantee seman-\\ntic integrity and meeting the required knowledge.

Among them, DenseX [30]proposed the concept of\\nusing propositions as retrieval units. Propositions are defined\\nas atomic expressions in the text, each encapsulating a unique\\nfactual segment and presented in a concise, self-contained nat-\\nural language format. This approach aims to enhance retrieval\\nprecision and relevance. On the Knowledge Graph (KG),\\nretrieval granularity includes Entity, Triplet, and sub-Graph.\\nThe granularity of retrieval can also be adapted to downstream\\ntasks, such as retrieving Item IDs [40]in recommendation tasks\\nand Sentence pairs [38]. Detailed information is illustrated in\\nTable I.\\nB. Indexing Optimization\\nIn the Indexing phase, documents will be processed, seg-\\nmented, and transformed into Embeddings to be stored in a\\nvector database. The quality of index construction determines\\nwhether the correct context can be obtained in the retrieval\\nphase.\\n1) Chunking Strategy: The most common method is to split\\nthe document into chunks on a fixed number of tokens (e.g.,\\n100, 256, 512) [88]. Larger chunks can capture more context,\\nbut they also generate more noise, requiring longer processing\\ntime and higher costs. While smaller chunks may not fully\\nconvey the necessary context, they do have less noise. How-\\never, chunks leads to truncation within sentences, prompting\\nthe optimization of a recursive splits and sliding window meth-\\nods, enabling layered retrieval by merging globally related\\ninformation across multiple retrieval processes [89]. Never-\\ntheless, these approaches still cannot strike a balance between\\nsemantic completeness and context length. Therefore, methods\\nlike Small2Big have been proposed, where sentences (small)\\nare used as the retrieval unit, and the preceding and following\\nsentences are provided as (big) context to LLMs [90].\\n2) Metadata Attachments: Chunks can be enriched with\\nmetadata information such as page number, file name, au-\\nthor,category timestamp. Subsequently, retrieval can be filtered\\nbased on this metadata, limiting the scope of the retrieval.\\nAssigning different weights to document timestamps during\\nretrieval can achieve time-aware RAG, ensuring the freshness\\nof knowledge and avoiding outdated information.\\nIn addition to extracting metadata from the original doc-\\numents, metadata can also be artificially constructed. For\\nexample, adding summaries of paragraph, as well as intro-\\nducing hypothetical questions. This method is also known as\\nReverse HyDE. Specifically, using LLM to generate questions\\nthat can be answered by the document, then calculating the\\nsimilarity between the original question and the hypothetical\\nquestion during retrieval to reduce the semantic gap between\\nthe question and the answer.\\n3) Structural Index: One effective method for enhancing\\ninformation retrieval is to establish a hierarchical structure for\\nthe documents. By constructing In structure, RAG system can\\nexpedite the retrieval and processing of pertinent data.\\nHierarchical index structure . File are arranged in parent-\\nchild relationships, with chunks linked to them. Data sum-\\nmaries are stored at each node, aiding in the swift traversal\\nof data and assisting the RAG system in determining which\\nchunks to extract. This approach can also mitigate the illusion\\ncaused by block extraction issues.\\nKnowledge Graph index . Utilize KG in constructing the\\nhierarchical structure of documents contributes to maintaining\\nconsistency. It delineates the connections between different\\nconcepts and entities, markedly reducing the potential for\\nillusions. Another advantage is the transformation of the\\ninformation retrieval process into instructions that LLM can\\ncomprehend, thereby enhancing the accuracy of knowledge\\nretrieval and enabling LLM to generate contextually coherent\\nresponses, thus improving the overall efficiency of the RAG\\nsystem. To capture the logical relationship between document\\ncontent and structure, KGP [91] proposed a method of building\\nan index between multiple documents using KG. This KG\\nconsists of nodes (representing paragraphs or structures in the\\ndocuments, such as pages and tables) and edges (indicating\\nsemantic/lexical similarity between paragraphs or relationships\\nwithin the document structure), effectively addressing knowl-\\nedge retrieval and reasoning problems in a multi-document\\nenvironment.\\nC. Query Optimization\\nOne of the primary challenges with Naive RAG is its\\ndirect reliance on the user’s original query as the basis for\\nretrieval. Formulating a precise and clear question is difficult,\\nand imprudent queries result in subpar retrieval effectiveness.\\nSometimes, the question itself is complex, and the language\\nis not well-organized. Another difficulty lies in language\\ncomplexity ambiguity. Language models often struggle when\\ndealing with specialized vocabulary or ambiguous abbrevi-\\nations with multiple meanings. For instance, they may not\\ndiscern whether “LLM” refers to large language model or a\\nMaster of Laws in a legal context.\\n1) Query Expansion: Expanding a single query into mul-\\ntiple queries enriches the content of the query, providing\\nfurther context to address any lack of specific nuances, thereby\\nensuring the optimal relevance of the generated answers.\\nMulti-Query. By employing prompt engineering to expand\\nqueries via LLMs, these queries can then be executed in\\nparallel. The expansion of queries is not random, but rather\\nmeticulously designed.\\nSub-Query. The process of sub-question planning represents\\nthe generation of the necessary sub-questions to contextualize\\nand fully answer the original question when combined. This\\nprocess of adding relevant context is, in principle, similar\\nto query expansion. Specifically, a complex question can be\\ndecomposed into a series of simpler sub-questions using the\\nleast-to-most prompting method [92].\\nChain-of-Verification(CoVe). The expanded queries undergo\\nvalidation by LLM to achieve the effect of reducing halluci-\\nnations. Validated expanded queries typically exhibit higher\\nreliability [93].'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 8, 'page_label': '9'}, page_content='9\\n2) Query Transformation: The core concept is to retrieve\\nchunks based on a transformed query instead of the user’s\\noriginal query.\\nQuery Rewrite.The original queries are not always optimal\\nfor LLM retrieval, especially in real-world scenarios. There-\\nfore, we can prompt LLM to rewrite the queries. In addition to\\nusing LLM for query rewriting, specialized smaller language\\nmodels, such as RRR (Rewrite-retrieve-read) [7]. The imple-\\nmentation of the query rewrite method in the Taobao, known\\nas BEQUE [9] has notably enhanced recall effectiveness for\\nlong-tail queries, resulting in a rise in GMV .\\nAnother query transformation method is to use prompt\\nengineering to let LLM generate a query based on the original\\nquery for subsequent retrieval. HyDE [11] construct hypothet-\\nical documents (assumed answers to the original query). It\\nfocuses on embedding similarity from answer to answer rather\\nthan seeking embedding similarity for the problem or query.\\nUsing the Step-back Prompting method [10], the original\\nquery is abstracted to generate a high-level concept question\\n(step-back question). In the RAG system, both the step-back\\nquestion and the original query are used for retrieval, and both\\nthe results are utilized as the basis for language model answer\\ngeneration.\\n3) Query Routing: Based on varying queries, routing to\\ndistinct RAG pipeline,which is suitable for a versatile RAG\\nsystem designed to accommodate diverse scenarios.\\nMetadata Router/ Filter . The first step involves extracting\\nkeywords (entity) from the query, followed by filtering based\\non the keywords and metadata within the chunks to narrow\\ndown the search scope.\\nSemantic Router is another method of routing involves\\nleveraging the semantic information of the query. Specific\\napprach see Semantic Router 6. Certainly, a hybrid routing\\napproach can also be employed, combining both semantic and\\nmetadata-based methods for enhanced query routing.\\nD. Embedding\\nIn RAG, retrieval is achieved by calculating the similarity\\n(e.g. cosine similarity) between the embeddings of the ques-\\ntion and document chunks, where the semantic representation\\ncapability of embedding models plays a key role. This mainly\\nincludes a sparse encoder (BM25) and a dense retriever (BERT\\narchitecture Pre-training language models). Recent research\\nhas introduced prominent embedding models such as AngIE,\\nV oyage, BGE,etc [94]–[96], which are benefit from multi-task\\ninstruct tuning. Hugging Face’s MTEB leaderboard 7 evaluates\\nembedding models across 8 tasks, covering 58 datasests. Ad-\\nditionally, C-MTEB focuses on Chinese capability, covering\\n6 tasks and 35 datasets. There is no one-size-fits-all answer\\nto “which embedding model to use.” However, some specific\\nmodels are better suited for particular use cases.\\n1) Mix/hybrid Retrieval : Sparse and dense embedding\\napproaches capture different relevance features and can ben-\\nefit from each other by leveraging complementary relevance\\ninformation. For instance, sparse retrieval models can be used\\n6https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router\\n7https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard\\nto provide initial search results for training dense retrieval\\nmodels. Additionally, pre-training language models (PLMs)\\ncan be utilized to learn term weights to enhance sparse\\nretrieval. Specifically, it also demonstrates that sparse retrieval\\nmodels can enhance the zero-shot retrieval capability of dense\\nretrieval models and assist dense retrievers in handling queries\\ncontaining rare entities, thereby improving robustness.\\n2) Fine-tuning Embedding Model: In instances where the\\ncontext significantly deviates from pre-training corpus, partic-\\nularly within highly specialized disciplines such as healthcare,\\nlegal practice, and other sectors replete with proprietary jargon,\\nfine-tuning the embedding model on your own domain dataset\\nbecomes essential to mitigate such discrepancies.\\nIn addition to supplementing domain knowledge, another\\npurpose of fine-tuning is to align the retriever and generator,\\nfor example, using the results of LLM as the supervision signal\\nfor fine-tuning, known as LSR (LM-supervised Retriever).\\nPROMPTAGATOR [21] utilizes the LLM as a few-shot query\\ngenerator to create task-specific retrievers, addressing chal-\\nlenges in supervised fine-tuning, particularly in data-scarce\\ndomains. Another approach, LLM-Embedder [97], exploits\\nLLMs to generate reward signals across multiple downstream\\ntasks. The retriever is fine-tuned with two types of supervised\\nsignals: hard labels for the dataset and soft rewards from\\nthe LLMs. This dual-signal approach fosters a more effective\\nfine-tuning process, tailoring the embedding model to diverse\\ndownstream applications. REPLUG [72] utilizes a retriever\\nand an LLM to calculate the probability distributions of the\\nretrieved documents and then performs supervised training\\nby computing the KL divergence. This straightforward and\\neffective training method enhances the performance of the\\nretrieval model by using an LM as the supervisory signal,\\neliminating the need for specific cross-attention mechanisms.\\nMoreover, inspired by RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from\\nHuman Feedback), utilizing LM-based feedback to reinforce\\nthe retriever through reinforcement learning.\\nE. Adapter\\nFine-tuning models may present challenges, such as in-\\ntegrating functionality through an API or addressing con-\\nstraints arising from limited local computational resources.\\nConsequently, some approaches opt to incorporate an external\\nadapter to aid in alignment.\\nTo optimize the multi-task capabilities of LLM, UP-\\nRISE [20] trained a lightweight prompt retriever that can\\nautomatically retrieve prompts from a pre-built prompt pool\\nthat are suitable for a given zero-shot task input. AAR\\n(Augmentation-Adapted Retriver) [47] introduces a universal\\nadapter designed to accommodate multiple downstream tasks.\\nWhile PRCA [69] add a pluggable reward-driven contextual\\nadapter to enhance performance on specific tasks. BGM [26]\\nkeeps the retriever and LLM fixed,and trains a bridge Seq2Seq\\nmodel in between. The bridge model aims to transform the\\nretrieved information into a format that LLMs can work with\\neffectively, allowing it to not only rerank but also dynami-\\ncally select passages for each query, and potentially employ\\nmore advanced strategies like repetition. Furthermore, PKG'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 9, 'page_label': '10'}, page_content='10\\nintroduces an innovative method for integrating knowledge\\ninto white-box models via directive fine-tuning [75]. In this\\napproach, the retriever module is directly substituted to gen-\\nerate relevant documents according to a query. This method\\nassists in addressing the difficulties encountered during the\\nfine-tuning process and enhances model performance.\\nIV. G ENERATION\\nAfter retrieval, it is not a good practice to directly input all\\nthe retrieved information to the LLM for answering questions.\\nFollowing will introduce adjustments from two perspectives:\\nadjusting the retrieved content and adjusting the LLM.\\nA. Context Curation\\nRedundant information can interfere with the final gener-\\nation of LLM, and overly long contexts can also lead LLM\\nto the “Lost in the middle” problem [98]. Like humans, LLM\\ntends to only focus on the beginning and end of long texts,\\nwhile forgetting the middle portion. Therefore, in the RAG\\nsystem, we typically need to further process the retrieved\\ncontent.\\n1) Reranking: Reranking fundamentally reorders document\\nchunks to highlight the most pertinent results first, effectively\\nreducing the overall document pool, severing a dual purpose\\nin information retrieval, acting as both an enhancer and a\\nfilter, delivering refined inputs for more precise language\\nmodel processing [70]. Reranking can be performed using\\nrule-based methods that depend on predefined metrics like\\nDiversity, Relevance, and MRR, or model-based approaches\\nlike Encoder-Decoder models from the BERT series (e.g.,\\nSpanBERT), specialized reranking models such as Cohere\\nrerank or bge-raranker-large, and general large language mod-\\nels like GPT [12], [99].\\n2) Context Selection/Compression: A common misconcep-\\ntion in the RAG process is the belief that retrieving as many\\nrelevant documents as possible and concatenating them to form\\na lengthy retrieval prompt is beneficial. However, excessive\\ncontext can introduce more noise, diminishing the LLM’s\\nperception of key information .\\n(Long) LLMLingua [100], [101] utilize small language\\nmodels (SLMs) such as GPT-2 Small or LLaMA-7B, to\\ndetect and remove unimportant tokens, transforming it into\\na form that is challenging for humans to comprehend but\\nwell understood by LLMs. This approach presents a direct\\nand practical method for prompt compression, eliminating the\\nneed for additional training of LLMs while balancing language\\nintegrity and compression ratio. PRCA tackled this issue by\\ntraining an information extractor [69]. Similarly, RECOMP\\nadopts a comparable approach by training an information\\ncondenser using contrastive learning [71]. Each training data\\npoint consists of one positive sample and five negative sam-\\nples, and the encoder undergoes training using contrastive loss\\nthroughout this process [102] .\\nIn addition to compressing the context, reducing the num-\\nber of documents aslo helps improve the accuracy of the\\nmodel’s answers. Ma et al. [103] propose the “Filter-Reranker”\\nparadigm, which combines the strengths of LLMs and SLMs.\\nIn this paradigm, SLMs serve as filters, while LLMs function\\nas reordering agents. The research shows that instructing\\nLLMs to rearrange challenging samples identified by SLMs\\nleads to significant improvements in various Information\\nExtraction (IE) tasks. Another straightforward and effective\\napproach involves having the LLM evaluate the retrieved\\ncontent before generating the final answer. This allows the\\nLLM to filter out documents with poor relevance through LLM\\ncritique. For instance, in Chatlaw [104], the LLM is prompted\\nto self-suggestion on the referenced legal provisions to assess\\ntheir relevance.\\nB. LLM Fine-tuning\\nTargeted fine-tuning based on the scenario and data char-\\nacteristics on LLMs can yield better results. This is also one\\nof the greatest advantages of using on-premise LLMs. When\\nLLMs lack data in a specific domain, additional knowledge can\\nbe provided to the LLM through fine-tuning. Huggingface’s\\nfine-tuning data can also be used as an initial step.\\nAnother benefit of fine-tuning is the ability to adjust the\\nmodel’s input and output. For example, it can enable LLM to\\nadapt to specific data formats and generate responses in a par-\\nticular style as instructed [37]. For retrieval tasks that engage\\nwith structured data, the SANTA framework [76] implements\\na tripartite training regimen to effectively encapsulate both\\nstructural and semantic nuances. The initial phase focuses on\\nthe retriever, where contrastive learning is harnessed to refine\\nthe query and document embeddings.\\nAligning LLM outputs with human or retriever preferences\\nthrough reinforcement learning is a potential approach. For\\ninstance, manually annotating the final generated answers\\nand then providing feedback through reinforcement learning.\\nIn addition to aligning with human preferences, it is also\\npossible to align with the preferences of fine-tuned models\\nand retrievers [79]. When circumstances prevent access to\\npowerful proprietary models or larger parameter open-source\\nmodels, a simple and effective method is to distill the more\\npowerful models(e.g. GPT-4). Fine-tuning of LLM can also\\nbe coordinated with fine-tuning of the retriever to align pref-\\nerences. A typical approach, such as RA-DIT [27], aligns the\\nscoring functions between Retriever and Generator using KL\\ndivergence.\\nV. A UGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG\\nIn the domain of RAG, the standard practice often involves\\na singular (once) retrieval step followed by generation, which\\ncan lead to inefficiencies and sometimes is typically insuffi-\\ncient for complex problems demanding multi-step reasoning,\\nas it provides a limited scope of information [105]. Many\\nstudies have optimized the retrieval process in response to this\\nissue, and we have summarised them in Figure 5.\\nA. Iterative Retrieval\\nIterative retrieval is a process where the knowledge base\\nis repeatedly searched based on the initial query and the text\\ngenerated so far, providing a more comprehensive knowledge'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 10, 'page_label': '11'}, page_content='11\\nFig. 5. In addition to the most common once retrieval, RAG also includes three types of retrieval augmentation processes. (left) Iterative retrieval involves\\nalternating between retrieval and generation, allowing for richer and more targeted context from the knowledge base at each step. (Middle) Recursive retrieval\\ninvolves gradually refining the user query and breaking down the problem into sub-problems, then continuously solving complex problems through retrieval\\nand generation. (Right) Adaptive retrieval focuses on enabling the RAG system to autonomously determine whether external knowledge retrieval is necessary\\nand when to stop retrieval and generation, often utilizing LLM-generated special tokens for control.\\nbase for LLMs. This approach has been shown to enhance\\nthe robustness of subsequent answer generation by offering\\nadditional contextual references through multiple retrieval\\niterations. However, it may be affected by semantic discon-\\ntinuity and the accumulation of irrelevant information. ITER-\\nRETGEN [14] employs a synergistic approach that lever-\\nages “retrieval-enhanced generation” alongside “generation-\\nenhanced retrieval” for tasks that necessitate the reproduction\\nof specific information. The model harnesses the content\\nrequired to address the input task as a contextual basis for\\nretrieving pertinent knowledge, which in turn facilitates the\\ngeneration of improved responses in subsequent iterations.\\nB. Recursive Retrieval\\nRecursive retrieval is often used in information retrieval and\\nNLP to improve the depth and relevance of search results.\\nThe process involves iteratively refining search queries based\\non the results obtained from previous searches. Recursive\\nRetrieval aims to enhance the search experience by gradu-\\nally converging on the most pertinent information through a\\nfeedback loop. IRCoT [61] uses chain-of-thought to guide\\nthe retrieval process and refines the CoT with the obtained\\nretrieval results. ToC [57] creates a clarification tree that\\nsystematically optimizes the ambiguous parts in the Query. It\\ncan be particularly useful in complex search scenarios where\\nthe user’s needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where\\nthe information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. The\\nrecursive nature of the process allows for continuous learning\\nand adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in\\nimproved satisfaction with the search outcomes.\\nTo address specific data scenarios, recursive retrieval and\\nmulti-hop retrieval techniques are utilized together. Recursive\\nretrieval involves a structured index to process and retrieve\\ndata in a hierarchical manner, which may include summarizing\\nsections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a\\nretrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary\\nretrieval within the document refines the search, embodying\\nthe recursive nature of the process. In contrast, multi-hop\\nretrieval is designed to delve deeper into graph-structured data\\nsources, extracting interconnected information [106].\\nC. Adaptive Retrieval\\nAdaptive retrieval methods, exemplified by Flare [24] and\\nSelf-RAG [25], refine the RAG framework by enabling LLMs\\nto actively determine the optimal moments and content for\\nretrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the\\ninformation sourced.\\nThese methods are part of a broader trend wherein\\nLLMs employ active judgment in their operations, as seen\\nin model agents like AutoGPT, Toolformer, and Graph-\\nToolformer [107]–[109]. Graph-Toolformer, for instance, di-\\nvides its retrieval process into distinct steps where LLMs\\nproactively use retrievers, apply Self-Ask techniques, and em-\\nploy few-shot prompts to initiate search queries. This proactive\\nstance allows LLMs to decide when to search for necessary\\ninformation, akin to how an agent utilizes tools.\\nWebGPT [110] integrates a reinforcement learning frame-\\nwork to train the GPT-3 model in autonomously using a\\nsearch engine during text generation. It navigates this process\\nusing special tokens that facilitate actions such as search\\nengine queries, browsing results, and citing references, thereby\\nexpanding GPT-3’s capabilities through the use of external\\nsearch engines. Flare automates timing retrieval by monitoring\\nthe confidence of the generation process, as indicated by the'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 11, 'page_label': '12'}, page_content='12\\nprobability of generated terms [24]. When the probability falls\\nbelow a certain threshold would activates the retrieval system\\nto collect relevant information, thus optimizing the retrieval\\ncycle. Self-RAG [25] introduces “reflection tokens” that allow\\nthe model to introspect its outputs. These tokens come in\\ntwo varieties: “retrieve” and “critic”. The model autonomously\\ndecides when to activate retrieval, or alternatively, a predefined\\nthreshold may trigger the process. During retrieval, the gen-\\nerator conducts a fragment-level beam search across multiple\\nparagraphs to derive the most coherent sequence. Critic scores\\nare used to update the subdivision scores, with the flexibility\\nto adjust these weights during inference, tailoring the model’s\\nbehavior. Self-RAG’s design obviates the need for additional\\nclassifiers or reliance on Natural Language Inference (NLI)\\nmodels, thus streamlining the decision-making process for\\nwhen to engage retrieval mechanisms and improving the\\nmodel’s autonomous judgment capabilities in generating ac-\\ncurate responses.\\nVI. T ASK AND EVALUATION\\nThe rapid advancement and growing adoption of RAG\\nin the field of NLP have propelled the evaluation of RAG\\nmodels to the forefront of research in the LLMs community.\\nThe primary objective of this evaluation is to comprehend\\nand optimize the performance of RAG models across diverse\\napplication scenarios.This chapter will mainly introduce the\\nmain downstream tasks of RAG, datasets, and how to evaluate\\nRAG systems.\\nA. Downstream Task\\nThe core task of RAG remains Question Answering (QA),\\nincluding traditional single-hop/multi-hop QA, multiple-\\nchoice, domain-specific QA as well as long-form scenarios\\nsuitable for RAG. In addition to QA, RAG is continuously\\nbeing expanded into multiple downstream tasks, such as Infor-\\nmation Extraction (IE), dialogue generation, code search, etc.\\nThe main downstream tasks of RAG and their corresponding\\ndatasets are summarized in Table II.\\nB. Evaluation Target\\nHistorically, RAG models assessments have centered on\\ntheir execution in specific downstream tasks. These evaluations\\nemploy established metrics suitable to the tasks at hand. For\\ninstance, question answering evaluations might rely on EM\\nand F1 scores [7], [45], [59], [72], whereas fact-checking\\ntasks often hinge on Accuracy as the primary metric [4],\\n[14], [42]. BLEU and ROUGE metrics are also commonly\\nused to evaluate answer quality [26], [32], [52], [78]. Tools\\nlike RALLE, designed for the automatic evaluation of RAG\\napplications, similarly base their assessments on these task-\\nspecific metrics [160]. Despite this, there is a notable paucity\\nof research dedicated to evaluating the distinct characteristics\\nof RAG models.The main evaluation objectives include:\\nRetrieval Quality. Evaluating the retrieval quality is crucial\\nfor determining the effectiveness of the context sourced by\\nthe retriever component. Standard metrics from the domains\\nof search engines, recommendation systems, and information\\nretrieval systems are employed to measure the performance of\\nthe RAG retrieval module. Metrics such as Hit Rate, MRR, and\\nNDCG are commonly utilized for this purpose [161], [162].\\nGeneration Quality . The assessment of generation quality\\ncenters on the generator’s capacity to synthesize coherent and\\nrelevant answers from the retrieved context. This evaluation\\ncan be categorized based on the content’s objectives: unlabeled\\nand labeled content. For unlabeled content, the evaluation\\nencompasses the faithfulness, relevance, and non-harmfulness\\nof the generated answers. In contrast, for labeled content,\\nthe focus is on the accuracy of the information produced by\\nthe model [161]. Additionally, both retrieval and generation\\nquality assessments can be conducted through manual or\\nautomatic evaluation methods [29], [161], [163].\\nC. Evaluation Aspects\\nContemporary evaluation practices of RAG models empha-\\nsize three primary quality scores and four essential abilities,\\nwhich collectively inform the evaluation of the two principal\\ntargets of the RAG model: retrieval and generation.\\n1) Quality Scores: Quality scores include context rele-\\nvance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. These qual-\\nity scores evaluate the efficiency of the RAG model from\\ndifferent perspectives in the process of information retrieval\\nand generation [164]–[166].\\nContext Relevance evaluates the precision and specificity\\nof the retrieved context, ensuring relevance and minimizing\\nprocessing costs associated with extraneous content.\\nAnswer Faithfulness ensures that the generated answers\\nremain true to the retrieved context, maintaining consistency\\nand avoiding contradictions.\\nAnswer Relevance requires that the generated answers are\\ndirectly pertinent to the posed questions, effectively addressing\\nthe core inquiry.\\n2) Required Abilities: RAG evaluation also encompasses\\nfour abilities indicative of its adaptability and efficiency:\\nnoise robustness, negative rejection, information integration,\\nand counterfactual robustness [167], [168]. These abilities are\\ncritical for the model’s performance under various challenges\\nand complex scenarios, impacting the quality scores.\\nNoise Robustness appraises the model’s capability to man-\\nage noise documents that are question-related but lack sub-\\nstantive information.\\nNegative Rejection assesses the model’s discernment in\\nrefraining from responding when the retrieved documents do\\nnot contain the necessary knowledge to answer a question.\\nInformation Integration evaluates the model’s proficiency in\\nsynthesizing information from multiple documents to address\\ncomplex questions.\\nCounterfactual Robustness tests the model’s ability to rec-\\nognize and disregard known inaccuracies within documents,\\neven when instructed about potential misinformation.\\nContext relevance and noise robustness are important for\\nevaluating the quality of retrieval, while answer faithfulness,\\nanswer relevance, negative rejection, information integration,\\nand counterfactual robustness are important for evaluating the\\nquality of generation.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 12, 'page_label': '13'}, page_content='13\\nTABLE II\\nDOWNSTREAM TASKS AND DATASETS OF RAG\\nTask Sub Task Dataset Method\\nQA Single-hop Natural Qustion(NQ) [111]\\n[26], [30], [34], [42], [45], [50], [52], [59], [64], [82]\\n[3], [4], [22], [27], [40], [43], [54], [62], [71], [112]\\n[20], [44], [72]\\nTriviaQA(TQA) [113]\\n[13], [30], [34], [45], [50], [64]\\n[4], [27], [59], [62], [112]\\n[22], [25], [43], [44], [71], [72]\\nSQuAD [114] [20], [23], [30], [32], [45], [69], [112]\\nWeb Questions(WebQ) [115] [3], [4], [13], [30], [50], [68]\\nPopQA [116] [7], [25], [67]\\nMS MARCO [117] [4], [40], [52]\\nMulti-hop HotpotQA [118] [23], [26], [31], [34], [47], [51], [61], [82]\\n[7], [14], [22], [27], [59], [62], [69], [71], [91]\\n2WikiMultiHopQA [119] [14], [24], [48], [59], [61], [91]\\nMuSiQue [120] [14], [51], [61], [91]\\nLong-form QA ELI5 [121] [27], [34], [43], [49], [51]\\nNarrativeQA(NQA) [122] [45], [60], [63], [123]\\nASQA [124] [24], [57]\\nQMSum(QM) [125] [60], [123]\\nDomain QA Qasper [126] [60], [63]\\nCOVID-QA [127] [35], [46]\\nCMB [128],MMCU Medical [129] [81]\\nMulti-Choice QA QuALITY [130] [60], [63]\\nARC [131] [25], [67]\\nCommonsenseQA [132] [58], [66]\\nGraph QA GraphQA [84] [84]\\nDialog Dialog Generation Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW) [133] [13], [27], [34], [42]\\nPersonal Dialog KBP [134] [74], [135]\\nDuleMon [136] [74]\\nTask-oriented Dialog CamRest [137] [78], [79]\\nRecommendation Amazon(Toys,Sport,Beauty) [138] [39], [40]\\nIE Event Argument Extraction WikiEvent [139] [13], [27], [37], [42]\\nRAMS [140] [36], [37]\\nRelation Extraction T-REx [141],ZsRE [142] [27], [51]\\nReasoning Commonsense Reasoning HellaSwag [143] [20], [66]\\nCoT Reasoning CoT Reasoning [144] [27]\\nComplex Reasoning CSQA [145] [55]\\nOthers Language Understanding MMLU [146] [7], [27], [28], [42], [43], [47], [72]\\nLanguage Modeling WikiText-103 [147] [5], [29], [64], [71]\\nStrategyQA [148] [14], [24], [48], [51], [55], [58]\\nFact Checking/Verification FEVER [149] [4], [13], [27], [34], [42], [50]\\nPubHealth [150] [25], [67]\\nText Generation Biography [151] [67]\\nText Summarization WikiASP [152] [24]\\nXSum [153] [17]\\nText Classification VioLens [154] [19]\\nTREC [155] [33]\\nSentiment SST-2 [156] [20], [33], [38]\\nCode Search CodeSearchNet [157] [76]\\nRobustness Evaluation NoMIRACL [56] [56]\\nMath GSM8K [158] [73]\\nMachine Translation JRC-Acquis [159] [17]'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 13, 'page_label': '14'}, page_content='14\\nTABLE III\\nSUMMARY OF METRICS APPLICABLE FOR EVALUATION ASPECTS OF RAG\\nContext\\nRelevance Faithfulness Answer\\nRelevance\\nNoise\\nRobustness\\nNegative\\nRejection\\nInformation\\nIntegration\\nCounterfactual\\nRobustness\\nAccuracy ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓\\nEM ✓\\nRecall ✓\\nPrecision ✓ ✓\\nR-Rate ✓\\nCosine Similarity ✓\\nHit Rate ✓\\nMRR ✓\\nNDCG ✓\\nBLEU ✓ ✓ ✓\\nROUGE/ROUGE-L ✓ ✓ ✓\\nThe specific metrics for each evaluation aspect are sum-\\nmarized in Table III.

D ISCUSSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS\\nDespite the considerable progress in RAG technology, sev-\\neral challenges persist that warrant in-depth research.This\\nchapter will mainly introduce the current challenges and future\\nresearch directions faced by RAG.\\nA. RAG vs Long Context\\nWith the deepening of related research, the context of LLMs\\nis continuously expanding [170]–[172]. Presently, LLMs can\\neffortlessly manage contexts exceeding 200,000 tokens 9. This\\ncapability signifies that long-document question answering,\\npreviously reliant on RAG, can now incorporate the entire\\ndocument directly into the prompt. This has also sparked\\ndiscussions on whether RAG is still necessary when LLMs\\n8https://www.trulens.org/trulens eval/core concepts rag triad/\\n9https://kimi.moonshot.cn\\nare not constrained by context. In fact, RAG still plays an\\nirreplaceable role. On one hand, providing LLMs with a\\nlarge amount of context at once will significantly impact its\\ninference speed, while chunked retrieval and on-demand input\\ncan significantly improve operational efficiency. On the other\\nhand, RAG-based generation can quickly locate the original\\nreferences for LLMs to help users verify the generated an-\\nswers. The entire retrieval and reasoning process is observable,\\nwhile generation solely relying on long context remains a\\nblack box. Conversely, the expansion of context provides new\\nopportunities for the development of RAG, enabling it to\\naddress more complex problems and integrative or summary\\nquestions that require reading a large amount of material to\\nanswer [49]. Developing new RAG methods in the context of\\nsuper-long contexts is one of the future research trends.\\nB. RAG Robustness\\nThe presence of noise or contradictory information during\\nretrieval can detrimentally affect RAG’s output quality. This\\nsituation is figuratively referred to as “Misinformation can\\nbe worse than no information at all”. Improving RAG’s\\nresistance to such adversarial or counterfactual inputs is gain-\\ning research momentum and has become a key performance\\nmetric [48], [50], [82]. Cuconasu et al. [54] analyze which\\ntype of documents should be retrieved, evaluate the relevance\\nof the documents to the prompt, their position, and the\\nnumber included in the context. The research findings reveal\\nthat including irrelevant documents can unexpectedly increase\\naccuracy by over 30%, contradicting the initial assumption\\nof reduced quality.

Another trend is to introduce SLMs with specific\\nfunctionalities into RAG and fine-tuned by the results of RAG\\nsystem. For example, CRAG [67] trains a lightweight retrieval\\nevaluator to assess the overall quality of the retrieved docu-\\nments for a query and triggers different knowledge retrieval\\nactions based on confidence levels.\\nD. Scaling laws of RAG\\nEnd-to-end RAG models and pre-trained models based\\non RAG are still one of the focuses of current re-\\nsearchers [173].The parameters of these models are one of\\nthe key factors.While scaling laws [174] are established for\\nLLMs, their applicability to RAG remains uncertain. Initial\\nstudies like RETRO++ [44] have begun to address this, yet the\\nparameter count in RAG models still lags behind that of LLMs.\\nThe possibility of an Inverse Scaling Law 10, where smaller\\nmodels outperform larger ones, is particularly intriguing and\\nmerits further investigation.\\nE. Production-Ready RAG\\nRAG’s practicality and alignment with engineering require-\\nments have facilitated its adoption. However, enhancing re-\\ntrieval efficiency, improving document recall in large knowl-\\nedge bases, and ensuring data security—such as preventing\\n10https://github.com/inverse-scaling/prize\\ninadvertent disclosure of document sources or metadata by\\nLLMs—are critical engineering challenges that remain to be\\naddressed [175].\\nThe development of the RAG ecosystem is greatly impacted\\nby the progression of its technical stack. Key tools like\\nLangChain and LLamaIndex have quickly gained popularity\\nwith the emergence of ChatGPT, providing extensive RAG-\\nrelated APIs and becoming essential in the realm of LLMs.The\\nemerging technology stack, while not as rich in features as\\nLangChain and LLamaIndex, stands out through its specialized\\nproducts. For example, Flowise AI prioritizes a low-code\\napproach, allowing users to deploy AI applications, including\\nRAG, through a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. Other\\ntechnologies like HayStack, Meltano, and Cohere Coral are\\nalso gaining attention for their unique contributions to the field.\\nIn addition to AI-focused vendors, traditional software and\\ncloud service providers are expanding their offerings to include\\nRAG-centric services. Weaviate’s Verba 11 is designed for\\npersonal assistant applications, while Amazon’s Kendra 12\\noffers intelligent enterprise search services, enabling users to\\nbrowse various content repositories using built-in connectors.\\nIn the development of RAG technology, there is a clear\\ntrend towards different specialization directions, such as: 1)\\nCustomization - tailoring RAG to meet specific requirements.\\n2) Simplification - making RAG easier to use to reduce the\\n11https://github.com/weaviate/Verba\\n12https://aws.amazon.com/cn/kendra/'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-03-28T00:54:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\ragsurvey.pdf', 'total_pages': 21, 'page': 15, 'page_label': '16'}, page_content='16\\nFig. 6.

However, a fully integrated,\\ncomprehensive platform concept is still in the future, requiring\\nfurther innovation and development.\\nF . Multi-modal RAG\\nRAG has transcended its initial text-based question-\\nanswering confines, embracing a diverse array of modal data.\\nThis expansion has spawned innovative multimodal models\\nthat integrate RAG concepts across various domains:\\nImage. RA-CM3 [176] stands as a pioneering multimodal\\nmodel of both retrieving and generating text and images.\\nBLIP-2 [177] leverages frozen image encoders alongside\\nLLMs for efficient visual language pre-training, enabling zero-\\nshot image-to-text conversions. The “Visualize Before You\\nWrite” method [178] employs image generation to steer the\\nLM’s text generation, showing promise in open-ended text\\ngeneration tasks.\\nAudio and Video . The GSS method retrieves and stitches\\ntogether audio clips to convert machine-translated data into\\nspeech-translated data [179]. UEOP marks a significant ad-\\nvancement in end-to-end automatic speech recognition by\\nincorporating external, offline strategies for voice-to-text con-\\nversion [180]. Additionally, KNN-based attention fusion lever-\\nages audio embeddings and semantically related text embed-\\ndings to refine ASR, thereby accelerating domain adaptation.\\nVid2Seq augments language models with specialized temporal\\nmarkers, facilitating the prediction of event boundaries and\\ntextual descriptions within a unified output sequence [181].\\nCode. RBPS [182] excels in small-scale learning tasks by\\nretrieving code examples that align with developers’ objectives\\nthrough encoding and frequency analysis. This approach has\\ndemonstrated efficacy in tasks such as test assertion genera-\\ntion and program repair. For structured knowledge, the CoK\\nmethod [106] first extracts facts pertinent to the input query\\nfrom a knowledge graph, then integrates these facts as hints\\nwithin the input, enhancing performance in knowledge graph\\nquestion-answering tasks.\\nVIII. C ONCLUSION\\nThe summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 6, empha-\\nsizes RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the capa-\\nbilities of LLMs by integrating parameterized knowledge from\\nlanguage models with extensive non-parameterized data from\\nexternal knowledge bases. The survey showcases the evolution\\nof RAG technologies and their application on many different\\ntasks. The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms\\nwithin the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modu-\\nlar RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over\\nits predecessors. RAG’s technical integration with other AI\\nmethodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning,\\nhas further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in\\nRAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve\\nits robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts.\\nRAG’s application scope is expanding into multimodal do-\\nmains, adapting its principles to interpret and process diverse\\ndata forms like images, videos, and code.

Unlike traditional chatbots that rely solely on the knowledge embedded in their training data, RAG systems combine the power of information retrieval with language generation to produce more accurate, contextual, and up-to-date responses.\\n\\nThis article will guide you through the fundamentals of RAG, explore the LangChain framework, and demonstrate how to build production-ready RAG applications. Whether you're a seasoned ML engineer or just starting your AI journey, you'll find practical insights and actionable advice.\\n\\nWhat is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?\\n\\nRAG is an architectural pattern that enhances language model outputs by incorporating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources. The process typically involves three key steps:\\n\\nRetrieval: When a user asks a question, the system searches a knowledge base (typically using semantic search) to find the most relevant documents or passages.\\n\\nAugmentation: The retrieved information is combined with the user's query to create an enriched prompt that provides context to the language model.\\n\\nGeneration: The language model uses both the query and the retrieved context to generate a grounded, factual response.\\n\\nThis approach offers several advantages over traditional LLM applications: reduced hallucinations, ability to incorporate recent information, citation of sources, and domain-specific expertise without expensive fine-tuning.\\n\\nThe LangChain Framework\\n\\nLangChain is an open-source framework that simplifies the development of LLM-powered applications. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools and abstractions for building RAG systems, including:\\n\\nDocument Loaders\\n\\nLangChain supports loading documents from various sources: PDFs, web pages, databases, APIs, and more. Each loader handles format-specific parsing and converts content into a standardized Document object with text content and metadata.\\n\\nText Splitters\\n\\nLarge documents need to be split into smaller chunks that fit within the context window of language models. LangChain offers sophisticated text splitters that respect semantic boundaries, such as the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter which intelligently splits on paragraph breaks, sentences, and words in that order.\\n\\nEmbeddings and Vector Stores\\n\\nTo enable semantic search, text chunks are converted into vector embeddings using models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3 or open-source alternatives. These embeddings are stored in vector databases (FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone, Qdrant) that support efficient similarity search.\\n\\nChains and LCEL\\n\\nLangChain 1.0 introduced LCEL (LangChain Expression Language), a declarative way to compose components using a pipe operator. This makes it easy to build complex workflows while maintaining readability and debuggability.\\n\\nBuilding Your First RAG System\\n\\nLet's walk through the process of building a basic RAG system:\\n\\nStep 1: Load and Process Documents\\n\\nStart by loading your knowledge base documents and splitting them into manageable chunks. A common configuration is 1000-character chunks with 200-character overlap to maintain context across boundaries.\\n\\nStep 2: Create Embeddings\\n\\nConvert your text chunks into vector embeddings using an embedding model. Consider factors like cost, quality, and whether you need local/private processing when choosing a model.\\n\\nStep 3: Set Up Vector Store\\n\\nStore your embeddings in a vector database. For development and testing, FAISS or Chroma work well. For production systems with large datasets, consider managed solutions like Pinecone or self-hosted Qdrant.\\n\\nStep 4: Build the Retrieval Chain\\n\\nCreate a chain that retrieves relevant documents for a query and passes them to a language model along with the query. Use LCEL to compose this pipeline elegantly.\\n\\nStep 5: Test and Iterate\\n\\nEvaluate your RAG system with diverse queries. Pay attention to retrieval quality (are the right documents being retrieved?) and generation quality (are the answers accurate and helpful?).\\n\\nBest Practices and Production Considerations\\n\\nChunk Size Optimization\\n\\nThere's no one-size-fits-all chunk size. Experiment with different sizes based on your content type. Technical documentation often works better with smaller chunks (500-800 characters), while narrative content can handle larger chunks (1500-2000 characters).\\n\\nMetadata Filtering\\n\\nEnrich your documents with metadata (source, date, category, author) and use it to filter search results. This can significantly improve retrieval precision for structured knowledge bases.\\n\\nHybrid Search\\n\\nCombine semantic (vector) search with keyword (BM25) search for more robust retrieval. Semantic search excels at understanding intent, while keyword search is better at exact matches and specific terminology.\\n\\nCost Management\\n\\nMonitor your embedding and LLM API costs. Consider caching frequently asked questions, using smaller/cheaper models where appropriate, and implementing rate limiting. Calculate costs before deploying to production.\\n\\nEvaluation Framework\\n\\nBuild a test set of question-answer pairs and measure metrics like answer relevance, faithfulness (does the answer align with retrieved context?), and context precision (are retrieved documents relevant?). Use tools like RAGAS for automated evaluation.\\n\\nAdvanced RAG Techniques\\n\\nQuery Transformation\\n\\nTransform user queries before retrieval to improve results. Techniques include query expansion, query decomposition (breaking complex queries into simpler sub-queries), and hypothetical document embeddings (HyDE).\\n\\nRe-ranking\\n\\nAfter initial retrieval, use a re-ranking model to reorder results based on relevance to the specific query. This two-stage approach (fast retrieval + quality ranking) offers better performance than single-stage retrieval.\\n\\nAdaptive Retrieval\\n\\nNot all queries need retrieval. Implement logic to determine when to use RAG versus when the language model can answer from its training data alone. This reduces latency and costs for simple queries.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nRAG represents a significant advancement in building intelligent, reliable AI applications. By combining the strengths of retrieval systems and language models, we can create applications that are both knowledgeable and grounded in verifiable information.\\n\\nThe LangChain framework makes it easier than ever to build production-ready RAG systems. As you embark on your RAG journey, remember to start simple, measure rigorously, and iterate based on real-world performance. The field is rapidly evolving, so stay curious and keep experimenting!\\n\\nAbout the Author: Dr. Amanda Foster is a machine learning researcher and AI educator with over 10 years of experience in NLP and information retrieval.
