    "CloudFlow is a distributed cloud platform built on microservices architecture. The platform consists of three main layers that work together to provide a robust, scalable infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API Gateway layer handles all incoming requests using OAuth 2.0 authentication and routes them through our service mesh powered by Istio. This layer provides load balancing, SSL termination, and request routing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Service Mesh layer orchestrates communication between microservices, providing service discovery, health checking, and automatic failover. It uses Kubernetes for container orchestration across multiple availability zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Storage layer implements a distributed database system with automatic replication across three availability zones. This ensures data durability and supports horizontal scaling based on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "CloudFlow guarantees 99.99% uptime SLA with triple redundancy across availability zones. The platform supports horizontal scaling with automatic load balancing, allowing each service to scale independently based on CPU and memory metrics.\"\"\",\n",

    "CloudFlow implements sophisticated auto-scaling mechanisms to handle varying workloads efficiently. The platform monitors real-time metrics to make intelligent scaling decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) adjusts the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization (target: 70%) and memory usage (target: 80%). When these thresholds are exceeded for more than 3 consecutive minutes, the system automatically provisions additional pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertical scaling adjusts resource allocation for individual services. CloudFlow can increase or decrease CPU and memory limits without downtime, using Kubernetes resource management capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform supports bursting to handle sudden traffic spikes. During burst periods, CloudFlow can temporarily scale up to 500% of baseline capacity for up to 15 minutes before triggering permanent scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load balancing distributes traffic across all available pods using a weighted round-robin algorithm. Health checks run every 10 seconds, and unhealthy pods are automatically removed from the rotation within 30 seconds.\"\"\",\n",

    "The Control Plane manages the overall system state, including service registration, configuration management, and orchestration. It runs on a dedicated cluster with five replicas for high availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Plane handles actual request processing and data flow. It consists of worker nodes that execute application workloads and process user requests. Each data plane node has 16 CPU cores and 64GB RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Observability Stack includes Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation. Metrics are collected every 15 seconds and retained for 90 days.\n",

To implement OAuth 2.0, direct users to the authorization endpoint at https://auth.cloudflow.io/oauth/authorize with your client_id and redirect_uri parameters.\n",

    "Solution: Verify your API key format starts with \"cf_live_\" and is exactly 40 characters. Check for extra spaces or newlines. Generate a new API key if the issue persists. API keys are case-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error: \"Rate Limit Exceeded\" (429)\n",

    "Solution: Increase client timeout to at least 30 seconds. For long-running operations, use async endpoints and poll for results. Check CloudFlow status page for any service degradation.\n",

    "Step 5 - Check Network Connectivity: Ensure your network allows outbound HTTPS traffic to *.cloudflow.io on port 443. Verify DNS resolution is working correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6 - Verify SDK Version: If using CloudFlow SDK, ensure you're running the latest version. Outdated SDKs may not support new API features or may have known bugs.\n",

      "Testing RAG pipeline with sample questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Q: What is CloudFlow's uptime SLA?\n",
      "   A: CloudFlow provides an uptime Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.9% for the Standard Tier, 99.95% for the Premium Tier, and 99.99% for the Enterprise Tier. These SLAs ensure high availability and reliability for users, with the Enterprise Tier offering the highest guarantee of uptime. Additionally, CloudFlow utilizes triple redundancy across availability zones to support this commitment. For Enterprise Tier customers, the platform also includes service credits if the 99.99% uptime SLA is not met.\n",
      "2. Q: What authentication methods does CloudFlow support?\n",
      "   A: CloudFlow supports two authentication methods: OAuth 2.0 and API Keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **OAuth 2.0**: Recommended for user-facing applications, it supports the Authorization Code flow. Access tokens issued are valid for 1 hour, while refresh tokens are valid for 30 days. To initiate authentication with OAuth 2.0, direct users to the authorization endpoint at `https://auth.cloudflow.io/oauth/authorize` with `client_id` and `redirect_uri` parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **API Keys**: Ideal for server-to-server communication and background jobs. API keys follow the format `cf_live_` followed by 32 alphanumeric characters. They do not expire unless explicitly revoked. To authenticate using an API key, include it in the Authorization header as `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`. All API requests must be sent over HTTPS, as HTTP requests are rejected with a 403 error.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both methods are secure and ensure proper access to CloudFlow platform resources depending on the use case.\n",
      "3. Q: How do I handle rate limit errors?\n",
      "   A: To handle rate limit errors (HTTP 429) in CloudFlow, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Implement Exponential Backoff:** Use a retry logic that exponentially increases the waiting time between retries. Start with a 1-second delay, then 2 seconds, then 4 seconds, and so on until the rate limit resets.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Check Rate Limit Headers:** CloudFlow responses include headers indicating your rate usage:\n",
      "   - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Total requests allowed per hour.\n",
      "   - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in the current limit window.\n",
      "   - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp indicating when the limit resets.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Use these headers to determine how close you are to the limit and manage request frequency accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Use Retry-After Header:** When rate limited, the response includes a `Retry-After` header indicating the exact number of seconds to wait before retrying. Respect this value to avoid additional rate limit errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Optimize API Usage:** Reduce the number of requests by batching operations, optimizing request logic, or using async endpoints when available.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Upgrade to Higher Tier:** If you consistently hit rate limits and your workload demands higher limits, consider upgrading to the Premium or Enterprise tier, which offer higher capacities and priority processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, you can minimize the impact of rate limits and maintain effective API usage.\n",

This uptime ensures high availability and reliability, supported by triple redundancy across availability zones. The **Enterprise Tier** customers benefit from this 99.99% SLA, which includes service credits in the event of a violation. The **Premium Tier** offers a slightly lower SLA of **99.95%**, and the **Standard Tier** provides an SLA guarantee of **99.9%** uptime. This robust SLA ensures minimal downtime and is complemented by CloudFlow’s disaster recovery mechanisms, including daily backups, multi-region replication, and automatic failover within approximately 5 minutes.\n",
