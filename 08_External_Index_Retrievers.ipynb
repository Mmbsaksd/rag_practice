Pei Wang y Ben Goertzel consideran que la diferencia clave entre los conceptos IAG e IA se halla en la “finalidad y alcance de la investigación.”\\u200b Esto quiere decir que la inteligencia artificial trata propiedades específicas en sus proyectos, como por ejemplo la capacidad de aprendizaje lingüístico o reconocimiento de imágenes, sin pretender integrarlas en un sistema más amplio. La IAG, en cambio, se refiere a emprendimientos cuya ambición cubre la entera complejidad de la inteligencia humana.\\nEs una fuente común de confusiones el hecho de que el significado original de IA se asemeja más a la actual IAG que a aquello que hoy en día se entiende, científicamente, como IA. Las habituales equivocaciones producidas entre ambos términos se deben a que, originariamente, IA designó el sueño de moda de la época (mediados del siglo XX): la conciencia artificial. En aquel momento parecía un campo de investigación prometedor pero, al devenir aparente la desproporción de las expectativas situadas sobre el sector  —y la realidad de que, aunque fuera posible alcanzar la conciencia artificial, esta meta sería mucho más lejana de lo anticipado— la decadencia en el estudio de aquello que se conocía con el nombre de IA fue notable.\\nPosteriormente al fracaso de esa generación pionera de investigadores, aquellos que permanecieron en general trasladaron su trabajo a otras materias más asumibles (sobre todo aspectos particulares de la inteligencia), y no volvieron a acercarse al reto de la conciencia artificial. Así pues, la expresión IA cobró un nuevo significado y un extenso ámbito de investigación')]\n",

Einstein also made important contributions to quantum theory. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, has been called \"the world\\'s most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for \"his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\".\\nBorn in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg) the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss federal polytechnic school in Zurich, graduating in 1900. He acquired Swiss citizenship a year later, which he kept for the rest of his life, and afterwards secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin, becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in 1917; he also became a German citizen again, this time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by the Nazi persecution of his fellow Jews, he decided to remain in the US, and was granted American citizenship in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research, later carried out as the Manhattan Project.\\nIn 1905, sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers. In them, he outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity, and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole. It introduced the cosmological constant and is further regarded as the first step in the field of modern theoretical cosmology. In 1917, Einstein wrote a paper which introduced the concepts of spontaneous emission and stimulated emission, the latter of which is the core mechanism behind the laser and maser, and which contained a trove of information that would be beneficial to developments in physics later on, such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics.\\nIn the middle part of his career, Einstein made important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons. With physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, he laid the groundwork for Bose–Einstein statistics. For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that ultimately proved unsuccessful. First, he advocated against quantum theory\\'s introduction of fundamental randomness into science\\'s picture of the world, objecting that \"God does not play dice\". Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from mainstream modern physics.\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein'}, page_content='Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist best known for developing the theory of relativity.

Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways that may be described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according to deterministic rules. (A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechanical device, with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require exponentially more time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. For example, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations. However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.\\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a linear combination of two states known as a quantum superposition. The result of measuring a qubit is one of the two states given by a probabilistic rule. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects amplify the probability of the desired measurement result. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform this amplification.\\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields). Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain quantum devices can outperform classical computers on narrowly defined tasks, a milestone referred to as quantum advantage or quantum supremacy. These tasks are not necessarily useful for real-world applications.\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing'}, page_content='A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that exploits superposed and entangled states.

The strength of the signal at each connection is determined by a weight, which adjusts during the learning process.\\nTypically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs.

      "Question: What is quantum computer and how does it work?\n",
      "Answer: A quantum computer is a type of computer that uses principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations. Unlike classical computers, which encode data in binary bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits. Qubits can exist in a superposition state, meaning they can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously, which allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of data and carry out complex computations simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers leverage two main principles of quantum mechanics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Superposition**: Qubits can exist in multiple states (both 0 and 1) at the same time, enabling parallel computation. This property makes quantum computers ideal for solving problems that require evaluating many possibilities simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Entanglement**: Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where qubits become interconnected, such that the state of one qubit is directly related to the state of the other, even if they are physically separated. This can enhance computational power by allowing qubits to collaborate in intricate ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers perform computations by manipulating qubits using quantum gates, analogous to logic gates in classical computers. These gates apply operations to qubits, changing their states via controlled quantum operations. The result of quantum computations is obtained by measuring the qubits, collapsing their superposition state into a classical outcome (0 or 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to these capabilities, quantum computers excel at solving certain types of problems that are infeasible for classical computers, such as factoring large numbers, simulating quantum systems, optimizing complex systems, and searching databases. However, as of now (2023), practical quantum computers are still in their early stages of development, with challenges such as error correction, stability, and scalability limiting their widespread application.\n"

      "Question: What are transformers in machine learning?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer (from multiple sources):\n",
      "Transformers in machine learning are advanced network architectures that have revolutionized the broader field of artificial intelligence by utilizing a mechanism called multi-head attention. First introduced in the landmark 2017 research paper *\"Attention Is All You Need\"* by Google researchers, the transformer architecture is foundational to modern AI applications, enabling state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "At their core, transformers take text or other sequential input data and process it by converting each element (e.g., words in a sentence) into numerical representations known as *tokens*. These tokens are further transformed into vectors through a word embedding lookup table. The key innovation lies in the way the transformer architecture processes these tokens: instead of analyzing the input sequentially, it uses a parallelized *multi-head attention mechanism*. This allows each token to be effectively contextualized in relation to other tokens within a given context window, which is critical for understanding dependencies across words or characters in a sentence, regardless of their positions. The multi-head attention mechanism amplifies the significance of relevant tokens while subtly diminishing irrelevant ones, enhancing the model’s ability to detect complex patterns in data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Academic sources emphasize that the robustness and predictions of models like transformers rely heavily on the quality of their input data and their underlying techniques. For instance, supervised machine learning validation techniques and structured frameworks such as DOME (data, optimization, model, evaluation) can ensure that transformers are rigorously tested and their performance optimized. The importance of such methods is echoed in applications like biology, where high-stakes predictions necessitate accurate modeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transformers are now the backbone of large language models and various applications across domains. Their introduction marked a clear departure from previous recurrent models like LSTMs, offering significantly faster training and superior scalability, thanks to their attention mechanisms and parallel processing capabilities. This architecture has become a key enabler of progress in both research-focused and industrial AI systems, contributing to the ongoing boom in artificial intelligence innovation.\n"

      "\n",
      "### **1. United States: Interest and Action on AI Governance**\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. has historically embraced a light-touch approach to AI regulation, but recent developments indicate growing interest in crafting guidelines to govern AI development and deployment. Policymakers are responding to concerns about AI impacting privacy, human rights, and the concentration of power in technology companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **AI Bill of Rights:** In October 2022, the Biden Administration unveiled a \"Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights.\" This framework laid out principles for responsible AI use, including protections against bias, discrimination, and misuse, as well as a stress on transparency and privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Executive Action:** The Biden Administration issued an Executive Order in 2023 establishing rules for federal agencies using AI systems. These rules focused on increasing transparency, addressing algorithmic bias, and safeguarding workers and communities from harmful AI deployments. However, the exact scope of these regulations was still under development.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Legislation in Progress:** By 2023, bipartisan discussions were ongoing in Congress, with lawmakers pushing for legislation on AI safety, data transparency, and frameworks for understanding intellectual property, cybersecurity, and liability.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. European Union: Pioneers of AI Regulation**\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Union has taken a global lead in AI governance through its efforts to create comprehensive regulatory frameworks:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act):** Initially proposed in 2021, the EU AI Act is one of the most ambitious attempts to regulate AI. The foundational principle of the Act is a risk-based approach, classifying AI applications into categories (low risk, limited risk, high risk, and unacceptable risk) and imposing strict obligations on developers and users of AI systems in the \"high risk\" category. For example, high-risk sectors like healthcare, transportation, and critical infrastructure may require additional scrutiny and certifications before an AI system can be deployed.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):** Although not specific to AI, GDPR directly impacts how AI developers handle data, requiring transparency and ensuring the rights of individuals whose data is used for AI training and operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EU's leadership in AI regulation is expected to influence policies worldwide, particularly with provisions about how AI models should respect human rights, ensure transparency, and limit mass surveillance.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3. United Nations and Global Cooperation**\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Generative AI Regulations:** In July 2023, China introduced rules regulating generative AI systems. All generative AI tools are required to ensure outputs align with social values and state-censored guidelines. Providers must submit their models for security reviews before launching them to the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Data and Privacy Rules:** China has introduced stringent rules through legislation like the **Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL)**, applicable to AI technologies using personal data. AI companies must obtain explicit consent for gathering and using personal information to train models.\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Australia** is in the consultation phase, focusing on policy discussions for the safe development of AI technologies, particularly around facial recognition and online harms.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **India** is considering frameworks to govern AI use, as its broader digital policy frameworks, like the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act**, indirectly shape AI regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **6. Broader Themes in AI Regulation**\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the board, several key themes are emerging in the landscape of AI regulation:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Transparency Mandates:** There is increasing global pressure for AI developers to disclose details about their datasets, architectures, and algorithms to prevent discrimination, bias, and unsafe practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Focus on Generative AI:** The rise of powerful generative AI models (like OpenAI's GPT models or Google's Bard) spurred concerns about misinformation, copyright violations, and ethical misuse. Many current regulations now include specific measures to monitor such systems.\n",
      "\n",
